## 命题规律透析

细节题考查的是文章中的具体信息和关键细节，是每年考研题型中出现次数最多的

题型，一般都有十几道题。与主旨题考查考生对于文章的总体理解不同，细节题考查的是考

生对于文章局部结构的掌握。细节题相对于其他题型比较简单，同时做好这类题对于考生在

阅读理解部分取得基础分和高分都有着至关重要的作用，因此考生应该争取做对全部的细节

题。细节题考查的内容包罗万象，根据阅读文章的具体情况而定。对于议论文来说，细节题

的考查范围一般为以下内容：事实、数据、新旧观点、从正面或者反面来论证的例子、文章

结论等。对于说明文来说，细节题一般都会涉及到某个具体的事件、现象或者人物，问题往

往涉及到：时间、地点、人物、事件特征；起因、过程、结果、意义；目的、条件、步骤、

方法； 数据、年代、世纪等。

细节题的提问方式非常多样，一般都两种形式，即不完整的陈述句和完整的问句形

式。在陈述句中，常用的引出问题的词语或者词组包括from, because of, by, according to 等。

在问句中，常用的疑问词包括what, which, where, who, when, how （也就是我们平时经常说

的新闻写作的五个“W”+ 一个“H”）。下面我们还将有更加详细的规律剖析。

173

如果进行进一步的细分，则细节题还可以分为以下4 类：1、考查事实和同义转化

的细节题，这种题目一般会把原文中的信息在不改变原意的情况下通过另一种说法来表述，

因此选项中有可能会出现一些新的考生不熟悉的信息。2、考查因果关系的细节题，这种题

目中一般要求考生根据题干中的信息在原文中找到某一个现象存在或事件发生的原因和结

果，及其之间的关系。3、考查例证关系的细节题，这种题目一般考查考生对于作者在文章

中进行举例的目的的理解，也就是说，要考生找出文章中某一个具体的实例所论证的观点。

4、考查方式和手段的细节题，这种题目要求考生从文章找出做某一件事情的方法和手段。

## 细节题正确答案选项的特点

1、原文中的某个或某些关键词语和词组在选项中由其同义词或者近义词代替，总体的语法

则没有变化。

2、通过语法的改变来重新叙述原文信息，比如在主动句和被动句之间进行变换，在一般陈

述句和it 引导的句子之间进行变换，在一般陈述句和强调句型之间进行变换等。

3、原文从某个角度叙述或论述某个现象或观点，而选项则从另一个角度进行叙述或者论述，

关于该现象或论点的本质没有任何变化。

4、原文和选项从相反的角度讨论同一个现象或者观点，如果原文正面表述则选项从反面切

入，而如果原文从反面论述那么选项就是正面的角度。

5、原文和选项之间是抽象和具体的关系，即如果原文是抽象的论述则选项是具体的实例，

相反，如果原文是具体的例子那么选项就在此基础上上升为抽象的概念或理论。

细节题干扰答案选项的特点

1、照抄原文，但是却故意改变其中的一两个起决定性作用的关键词语，从而改变句意，与

原文意思相左。

2、与常识相违背，或者在基本的逻辑上无法自圆其说。

3、与原文的意思相反。

4、把原文的信息进行张冠李戴，即把关于A 的细节放到B 上面，从而干扰考生阅读后的记

忆。

5、把原文的意思进行扩大或者缩小，即去原文部分的意思，或者扩大原文某个表述的外延。

6、使用一些表示绝对性意思的字眼，这些词语我们在总论中多次提及，一般都不会是正确

选项。

7、一些与原文无关的、或者在原文中根本没有出现过的信息。

# 细节题解题方法

在总论中我们曾经指出，考生在阅读文章的时候要在一些标记性词汇上坐上一些标

志，这些标志对于细节题尤其有用。考生根据阅读一次的印象和这些标志就能够迅速定位该

问题相对应的句子，从而找到答案。在做题时只要阅读与题目相关的句子即可，不用花太多

时间看上下文。需要注意的是，正确答案不一定与原文一模一样，而往往出现原文的同义释

义或者同义词和近义词。

179

此外，如果考查细节的因果关系，要抓住表示因果意义的单词来分析。在没有明显的表

示因果关系的情况下，就应该通过分析其逻辑关系来判断。

如果是考查细节的例证关系，则应该阅读文中举例出的前后句，因为在这些地方往往会

出现一个总结说明的句子，而这个句子就是正确答案，当然可能在表述上与选项有所不同。

另外，有一些例子看上去好像在论证某个枝节的问题，但实际上却和文章的中心思想紧密相

连，因此在做题时要记住紧扣文章主题，因为每一个例子都是为了文章的中心思想服务的。

最后，在遇到一些涉及细节的“三选一”题目中，要充分运用排除法帮助做题。
