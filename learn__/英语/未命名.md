第一章、考研英语阅读理解**A** 总论

一、阅读理解**A** 简介与概论

（一）、大纲要求

考研英语阅读理解一共由A、B、C 三个部分组成，本书主要涉及A 部分，即单项选择

题。根据考试大纲的要求，考生应能综合运用英语语言知识和阅读既能来理解选自各类书籍

和报刊的不同类型的英文书面文字材料，能以每分钟60 个词的速度阅读各种题材和题材的

文字材料（生词量不超过所读材料总词汇量的3%），还应读懂与本人学习或工作有关的文

献、技术说明和产品介绍等。大纲进一步规定考生应该能够：

1、理解主旨要义；

2、理解文中的信息；

3、理解文中的概念性含义；

4、进行有关的判断、推理和引申；

5、根据上下文推测生词的词义；

6、理解文章的总体结构以及上下文之间的关系；

7、理解作者的意图、观点或态度；

8、区分论点和论据。

关于A 部分的20 道选择题，大纲还进行了更加细化的说明：“主要考查考生理解具体信息、

掌握文章大意、猜测生词词义并进行推断等能力。要求考生根据所提供的四篇（总长度约为

1，600 词）文章的内容，从每题所给出的四个选项中选出最佳答案。考生在答题卡1 上作

答。”

（二）、考研阅读理解的重要性和总体策略

考研阅读理解A 部分共四篇文章，共20 道题，每小题2 分，共40 分。可见，这部分

所占的比分占据了相当大的比重，对于考研英语的总体成败起到了至关重要的作用。而作为

考研的必考科目，英语又是考研能够成功的决定性因素之一，因此总的看来，考研阅读理解

2

成为了重中之重。但是历年的硕士生入学英语考试结束之后，我们都会听到很多考生扼腕叹

息，很多人质疑明明自己看懂了文章大意和各个选项的意思，却为何还是一败涂地！

究其原因，其根本在于所谓的看懂了原文，其实只是对原文的一个模糊大致的了解，大

部分考生在浏览一遍全文之后理解的程度在于80% 到至多是90% 之间，剩下那10%-20%

的内容都隐藏在文章的字里行间，需要考生仔细的琢磨和思考，而由于考研时间所限，考生

往往没有足够的时间进行仔细推敲。因此，这10%-20%的内容便成了考验阅读理解经常光

顾的部分，也成为了考生失分的一大重要原因。其实要理解这一点并不难。大家想象一下平

时我们阅读中文的报刊文章，也只是粗粗略读只求理解大致意思，没有人会抱着一本《青年

文摘》去仔细分析其中每一句话的内涵。同样，我们在阅读英文报刊文章的时候，也养成了

只求掌握梗概的习惯，而这正是考研阅读理解的大忌。

因此，如何能够在短短的时间内迅速把握文章90%-100%的含义成为了考研英语阅读制

胜的关键因素。笔者认为，只有充分破解考研阅读的命题规律，考生才能有的放矢、游刃有

余地把握阅读理解文章。而本书的目的就在于帮助考生去挖掘和发现考研阅读的命题规律，

即为什么题目会那么难，出题者究竟是如何把题目难度提上去的，哪一些内容和细节容易成

为出题者关注的目标，题目看似千变万化但是否“万变不离其宗”有其不变的模式，如何识破

错误选项的设计等等。所谓“知己知彼，百战不殆”，对命题规律的中分了解将会显著提高考

生准备考研阅读的效率，从而做到事半功倍。

（三）、考研阅读理解文章的来源和特点

考研英语阅读理解A 部分的四篇文章一般都是来自英美国家一些享有较高声誉的权威

报刊杂志，如_Newsweek_（《新闻周刊》）_, Now York Times_（《纽约时报》）, _U.S. News and Worl d_

_Report_ （《美国新闻与世界报道》）, _The Economist_ （《经济学家》）, _Times_（《时代周

刊》）等等。文章内容既包罗万象又具有相当的时效性，大多涉及当年的热门话题，包括了

社会科学、自然科学、人文科学等各个领域。其中，社会科学领域的题材囊括了经济、心理、

教育、传播、家庭、人口、交通、环境、能源、法律、体育等各个方面，自然科学则包括了

医学、生物、大气、地质、海洋、遗传、空间、信息、工程、农业等，而人文科学包括了语

言学、哲学、文化、历史、艺术、文学评论、散文等。从体裁上看，大纲要求考生能够顺利

读懂四类文章，分别为议论文、说明文、记叙文和应用文。不过，考研阅读理解的文章大多

为说明文或者议论文。正对这两类文章，考生应该有不同的阅读重点和策略。对于说明文来

说，最重要的是抓住文章的说明对象、事实和数据；对于议论文来说，最重要的是总结作者

的观点和结论、抓住作者的态度，以及作者的观点和态度与其他人的观点和态度之间的关

系等等。1993 年至2008 年上述三个领域文章的分布如下表：

3

由上表可见，社会科学是考研英语阅读的主要和重点选材，自然科学一直保持在1 篇文章左

右的分量，人文科学的重要性则有上升的趋势。

考生在准备考研的过程中，应该充分重视上述的一些英美报纸杂志，平时要多看这些刊

物，尤其是其中的议论、评论、报道和分析文章等。现在在国内买到英美国家原版报刊杂志

的过刊还是比较容易的。如果考生想掌握最新文章，可以登陆这些刊物的官方网站去阅读，

通常这些文章都是免费的，但有的需要交费订阅才可以，考生可以灵活把握。笔者在这里主

要推荐_The Economist_ （《经济学家》）的网站，不仅因为_The Economist_ 是考研选材的重

社会科学自然科学人文科学

4

点刊物之一，同时，考生在上面可以免费阅读近一两年的印刷版文章，非常方便实用。如果

考生有着广泛阅读的兴趣和习惯，能紧跟时代步伐、了解全球的重大事件、信息和资讯，就

能够为考研阅读准备丰富厚实的背景材料，因而在阅读时可以充分利用自己的相关知识来帮

助理解原文。考生应特别重视加强对于美国文化背景知识的了解，因为美国报纸杂志以及关

于美国的报道是近几年考研阅读文章选材的重点。

以下是部分英美权威报刊杂志的网站地址：

_The Economist_ （《经济学家》）：www.economist.com

_Newsweek_ （《新闻周刊》）： www.newsweek.com,id

_Times_（《时代周刊》）： www.timesonline.co.uk,tol,news

_U.S. News and World Report_ 《美国新闻与世界报道》）： www.usnews.com

_Now York Times_ （《纽约时报》）：www.nytimes.com

（四）、考研阅读理解文章的语言难度

考研阅读理解文章的语言难度主要体现在词汇和长句上。对于词汇而言，考研阅读文章

的词汇一般不会超出考试大纲规定的词汇范围，有5%左右的派生词和合成词，另外约有2%-

3% 的超纲词。很多考生对于超纲词望而生畏，其实超纲词只是一只“纸老虎”而已。考试大

纲规定，如果出现了影响文章理解的超纲词，应该在试卷上注明其汉语意思，如1994 年Text 4

中的pancreas （胰腺）、genes（基因），Text 5 中的mold（霉）。但是自从1995 年以后

的考研阅读文章中不再出现任何汉语注释，这并不意味着文章中除去了任何超纲词汇，而是

因为这些词或者不会影响对文章的整体理解、或者能够凭借语法或者上下文来猜测词义，因

此没有给出汉语意思的必要，需要考生利用逻辑推断能力来进行判断。

阅读理解真正的大敌在于长难句。考研阅读理解所选文章一般都充斥着各种长句和复杂

句，其中包括并列句、多重复合句、强调句、被动句、省略句、倒装句、分割句、双重否定

句、非限定性定语从句，同时句子中的分隔、插入、省略、同位语、虚拟语气、形式主语或

者宾语等现象也层出不穷，考生往往读完一个洋洋洒洒的长句之后就陷入了云里雾里、不知

所云。因此，长难句是提高阅读理解能力的制约瓶颈，增加了文章的难度。此外，英语文章

往往具有较强的逻辑性和哲理性，如果考生在阅读过程中无法把握文章的内在逻辑，也会使

做题的效率和准确率大打折扣。

大部分参加研究生入学考试的考生都通过了大学英语四、六级的考试，而且在阅读理解

这部分上也取得了不错的成绩。但是为何考研阅读却成为了啃不了的硬骨头呢？究其原因就

5

在于，大学英语四、六级是针对大部分大学生的一种测试，主要在于考查大学生在大学期间

的英语学习成果，其宗旨是希望大多数学生都能够在正规英语课堂训练之后通过这些测试，

因此四、六级考的主要是水平和速度。而考研阅读考的则是更高层次的英语能力，因为研究

生入学考试是一种选拔性测试，意在通过考试选出优秀的学生进行深造，因而对考生各方面

的素质和能力、包括英语阅读能力提出了更高的要求。因此，想比四、六级考试的阅读文章

和阅读题，考研阅读文章选材更加广泛，文章不论从长度、词汇、句子、还是逻辑等各个角

度来说难度都远远大于四、六级，同时命题也更加具有多变性和迷惑性。这些都对考生的实

战能力提出了更高的要求，特别要对阅读理解题目的考点和命题原则知根知底。一般来说，

四、六级阅读每篇花大约8-10 分钟就能够完成，而考研阅读每篇则需要10-20 分钟。

（五）、考研阅读理解的考点和命题原则

根据笔者对考研英语阅读理解文章以及题目多年进行的潜心研究，总结出了以下13

个重点考点和四大命题原则。考生应该熟记这些重点考点，并在平时的练习中训练自己对这

些考点的敏感程度，做到使自己的神经能够一找到这些考点就会条件反射般地兴奋起来，从

而增强对重点的记忆和理解。下面首先将一一介绍阅读理解文章的敏感考点。

**1**、首段和尾段

一篇文章的主题句、或者说是中心思想往往出现在文章的首段或者尾段。大家在阅读了

一定数量的文章之后就能够发现，许多文章开门见山地在文章第一段中就提出了要说明的

对象或者要论证的观点，这些中心思想句的位置一般都是文章第一句话或者第一段的最后一

两句话。

此外，文章的最后一段一般都会对全文的说明和论证进行总结，这些句子往往位于最后

一段的第一句话或最后一句话。通过一些标志性词汇或者短语，我们可以更快地找到这些总

结性句子，如：all in all, in short, to conclude, in consequence, in summary, in a word, as a result,

therefore, accordingly, thus 等。

主题句考查了考生是否能够把握文章大意的能力，因此是常考且几乎是必考的一个考

点。

**2**、段首和段尾

无论是说明文还是议论文，一篇文章往往会分成几个部分或层次进行说明和论证，每一

个段落一般都是一个部分或者层次。英美人写文章的逻辑性非常强，文章结构都非常规范，

因此每个段落的首句和尾句也经常是该段落的中心思想句，因此也是出题的重点区域，涉及

6

的问题包括了中心思想题、推理判断题和细节题等。下文也将会提到，在进行快速阅读的时

候，考生只需要浏览文章每一段的第一句话就大致能够判断这篇文章的中心思想和主旨。

**3**、长难句

上文提到了长难句是阅读理解的主要难度所在，其中包含了同位语、插入语、定语、不

定式、分词、各种从句等，使得句子长达好几行。因此这些复杂的句型也往往成为了试题的

重点所在。考生应该加强训练自己对付长难句的能力，平时练习中有意识地去分解这些句子，

理解其中的指代关系和句子层次。

**4**、列举处

所谓的列举是指通过一些表示顺承关系的词语逐项列出一些事实或者观点，标志性的词

汇包括First, Second, Third… ; Firstly, Secondly, Thirdly… Finally; First of all, Then, In addition,

Further, Furthermore, Besides, Moreover… 针对这一考点的题目通常考查文章细节，有时候

也涉及对文章内容的推理判断。这种题目没有固定的提问方式，不过通常会有两种题型：第

一种是从四个答案选项中选择正确的一项，错误选项的意思往往与文章的意思相反或因果关

系颠倒；第二中是从四个答案选项中选择错误的一项，即“except”题型，一般对照原文就能

够找出错误的选项。

**5**、举例处

一般的说明文和议论文都需要一些例子来支持作者的说明和论证，这些例子往往与作者

的说明与论述有很大的关联，具有重大的意义，因此也成为了考题出处的热点。这种题目在

文章中的线索非常明显，一般都带有如下的标志性词汇：for example, for instance, take … as

an example, as, such as, like 等。在做这种题目的时候，考生要牢记所举的例子一般都与文章

的中心思想有着密切的联系，因此要在选项中去寻找与中心思想意思最接近的那一项。同时，

一般文章举例处的前一句或者前几句就是与该例子相关的作者论点，所以在做此类题目的时

候就需要追本溯源地往前读，才能保证所选答案的正确率。1999 年以后几乎每年的考研阅

读题中都有1-2 道关于例证的题目，这应当引起考生的高度重视。常用的举例方法有两种：

一是先提出观点，后举例说明；二是先列举事例再做出结论。考生应当学会举一反三，在具

体的阅读文章中识别出个种例证。

**6**、引用处

说明文或者议论文中经常引用他人的观点来支持、佐证作者的观点。引文有可能是从正

面来支持作者的观点，也有可能是作者通过驳斥反面观点从而论证自己的观点。因此，引文

间接地表达了作者自己的观点，有一定的隐蔽性和迷惑性，所以也是出题考查的热点地区，

通常会考查考生的推理能力和对作者态度观点的判断能力。

7

**7**、因果关系处

表示因果关系的句子也是考研英语命题者所青睐的出题来源，因为因果句阐述了两个事

件或者事实之间的内在联系，是作者进行分析或者得出结论的地方。出题者为了考查考生的

阅读能力和逻辑分析能力，经常会把含有因果关系的句子倒过来考，因此选项中因变成了果、

果变成了因，考生需要注意辨别实际的因果关系，防止受到迷惑。

表示因果关系的词语有：because, because of, so, for, since, as, thus, therefore,

consequently, in consequence, as a result; result from, result in, cause, originate from, lead to,

attribute to, derive from; base, basis, reason, result, consequence 等。有时候文章中虽然没有出现

表示因果关系的标志性词语，但是在逻辑上也存在着因果关系，这个时候考生就需要自己进

行判断和推理。

**8**、转折、对比和类比处

文章的转折出也是体现作者观点和文章主题的地方，作者经常通过先抑后扬的办法在转

折词之后才明确提出自己的观点。一些明显的转折词包括but, however, on the contrary, yet, as

a matter of fact, in fact, actually 等，转折词前后的意思一般来说都是相反的，而作者会偏重其

中的某一方。因此，在阅读过程中看到转折词，考生最好能作上标志以方便做题时候的查找。

另外，作者也经常把两个事物、两件事实、两种观点进行对比，从而论证自己观点的正

确性。表示对比的一些标志性词语有in contrast, in comparison, compared with 等。特别需

要指出的是，只要文章第一段中出现一组对比的概念或事物，这个地方往往会成为考题的命

题重点，考生应掌握这一规律，在看到文章首段出现转折对比的内容时，应当立即集中注意

力，同时还要明白，第一段出现转折关系时，转折后所表述的一定是文章的中心思想，而在

首段出现的对照或对比的内容将在下文中进行具体的议论，并在文章最后得出结论。

此外，由于议论文和说明文在论证说明事理的时候非常抽象，为了让读者更形象地理解

这些抽象的概念，文章经常会运用类比的手法以增强文章的生动性。好的类比手法不仅有助

于将抽象的道理阐释清楚，更可以让读者加深印象。类比在文中有两种体现方式，一是明喻，

即A 像B 一样；二是暗喻，说A 是B，由于暗喻更加隐蔽，近年来命题专家也越来越趋向

于在暗喻内容上设置问题。

**9**、特殊词汇

考研阅读试题中经常考查考生对于一些词语和词汇的理解，这些特殊词汇包括了平时不

经常使用的生僻词、常见词语平时不经常用到的意思或搭配、以及关系代词等。这类题目的

解题关键在于读懂词汇所在文章位置的上下文，从而推断中其意思。

**10**、数字和年代

8

考研阅读中经常出现对于数字和年代等细节的考查，看似容易，但是考生经常由于疏忽

大意而失掉这些最容易的分数。其中要注意以下几点原则：首先，如果出现需要进行运算的

题目，一般来说文章的原始数据不是正确答案；其次，如果答案中的四个数字或者时间都与

文章的某一个部分相符合，那么要注意这些数字和时间所对应的不同问题，只选择与题目

相关的那个数据；此外，要注意年份和世纪之间的差别，比如1999 年就是20 世纪，2009

年就是21 世纪，也就是说世纪的数字是年份的前两个数字加1。如果考生记不住这个原则，

那么可以在考试的时候用自己熟悉的年份和世纪进行现场推算。

**11**、专有名词

所谓的专有名词包括人名、地名、机构名称、书籍文章影视作品的名称以及其他专有名

词。在阅读文章的过程中，考生每每遇到专有名词可以用铅笔作上标记，以便如果在题目中

出现相应专有名词可以进行快速定位。

**12**、特殊标点符号

有一些特殊的标点符号也经常成为出题的对象，因此考生应该对以下标点符号的用法较

为熟悉：冒号、括号、破折号以及引号。

􀁺 逗号：两个逗号之间的内容、或者一个逗号后面的内容，通常都起到补充说明第一个逗

号前面内容的作用。

􀁺 冒号：冒号后面的内容通常都是用来解释说明前面的内容，例如前面是抽象的概念后面

就是对这个概念的具体说明。

􀁺 括号：括号中间的内容通常用来解释或补充说明括号前面的内容。

􀁺 破折号：两个破折号之间的内容、或者一个破折号后面的内容，通常表示解释说明或者

补充说明。

􀁺 引号：表示引用他人的观点，一般用来从正面或者反面支持作者的观点。

相关的考题一般都是关于文章细节的问题。需要注意的是考题在考查标点符号用法是往往不

会明确说明，需要考生自己去判断并根据具体情况分析标点符号的用法。

**13**、最高级以及绝对性词汇

最高级词汇以及其他一些表示唯一性的词汇由于其意义的绝对性，因而不容易产生歧

义，所以也经常成为出题对象。这些词语包括形容词和副词的最高级，以及以下词汇：only,

sole (solely), mere (merely), sheer, simply, entirely, absolutely, just, always, forever, never, none,

must, all, any (anyone, anybody, anywhere) 等。

考研英语阅读四大命题原则

命题专家在设计阅读题目时，总是会使尽浑身解数以各种方式迷惑考生，为他们选择正

确的答案设置各种障碍。以下四大原则就是考研命题专家们最常用的一些方式和原则：

• 语言简化：“语言简化”是命题专家使用语言时所必须遵守的一条重要原则。一般来

说，一道题的四个答案不仅长度差不多，语言的用词水平和语法难度也都差不多。

此外，答案的文字难度一般低于文章本身，这也是对考生非常有利的一点，有时候

甚至还可以通过答案来帮助理解原文。由于这是一个普遍的原则，在这里我们就不

具体地举例子。

• 关键词替换：关键词替换是阅读理解题目中出现最频繁的命题原则，一般都会在正

确答案中用原文某个关键词的同义词或者近义词进行替代。或者从更广的意义上来

说，有时候命题者会以和原文意思相同但是遣词造句不同的方式来设计正确答案，

即用不同的话把原文的某个句子复述一遍，而错误答案反而往往会看上去和原文差

不多，这个时候考生需要仔细阅读加以区别。

例题：This speeding up of life, says the Futurist, receives a new form of expression.

Futurists claim that we must.

［A］ increase the production of literature

［B］ use poetry to relieve modern stress

［C］ develop new modes of expression

［D］ avoid using adjectives and verbs［2000 年第61 题］

［正确答案］C

• 正话反说：即选项用否定的方式（如双重否定句，或者一个否定形式加上另一个否

定词如never, none 等）来表述文中用肯定方式所表述的内容，两者的意思是相同的。

例题：How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the

tree? Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His

mind was ready for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of

research. If you don't have unpredictable things, you don't have research. Scientists tend to

forget this when writing their cut and dried reports for the technical journals, but history is

filled with examples of it.

The author asserts that scientists

10

［A］shouldn't replace “scientific method” with imaginative thought

［B］shouldn't neglect to speculate on unpredictable things

［C］should write more concise reports for technical journals

［D］should be confident about their research findings［1999 年第68 题］

［正确答案］B

• 反话正说：顾名思义，即文中用否定方式所来表述一定的内容，而选项中用肯定的

方式把同样的意思再表达一遍。

例题：“Few Americans attribute this solely to such obvious causes as a devalued dollar or the

turning of the business cycle.”

The author seems to believe the revival of the U.S. economy in the 1990s can be attributed to

the.

［A］ turning of the business cycle

［B］ restructuring of industry

［C］ improved business management

［D］ success in education［2000 年第54 题］

［正确答案］A

（六）、考研阅读理解文章的结构特点

对于一篇完整的英文说明文或者议论文来说，不论其形式看上去有多么复杂多样，但是

套用一句老话：“万变不离其宗。”一般考研阅读的文章都是采取传统的三段论形式：即提出

问题（提出说明的事物或者现象）、分析问题（对事物或者现象进行说明）、解决问题（对

说明的事物或者现象进行总结）。当然这里所说的“三段论”不是指所有的文章都分为三个段

落，但是大部分文章基本上都是由这三个部分组成的。下面我们列举几种具体的情况来进行

简单的分析，并在每种模式后面都举出了一篇考研真题的文章以帮助具体考生理解这些模式

的特点，考生在平时的复习中也应该自己注意训练相关的判断力。

模式**1**、第一部分：提出问题，可以开门见山地提出问题或者先阐述他人的观点然后揭示自

己与之相左的观点；

第二部分：层层递进地进行分析，段落之间的逻辑联系非常强，每一段的论述都

之前一段为依据，这些段落经常以moreover, further, furthermore, besides, in addition

等词语或者词组开头；

11

第三部分：在第二部分逻辑推理的基础上得出结论。

例文：95 年Passage 3

In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become

complicated. Many of life’ s problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or

colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert

information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people

today.

In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War Ⅱ. As families

move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family

relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that

information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost

unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things

once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be

consciously learned.

Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now

has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one piece of

information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated , time-consuming and

sometimes even overwhelming .

Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which

enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has

ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in

machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information.

Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very

shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended

the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared

world wide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the

participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has

facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making

more information available to more people.

In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance.

Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems,

the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed.

"Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most

critical requirement of all people.

12

其中中间三段的第一句话都是对上文的承接并引出新的话题，分别为“In addition to

this…”、“Adding to societal changes is an enormous stockpile of information”、“Coupled with the

growing quantity of information is…”。

模式**2**、第一部分：开头提出一个概念、一个中心思想或者一种现象；

第二部分：围绕着这个概念、中心思想或者现象，从各个方面进行分析和解释说

明，这种文章比较容易定位其主旨；

第三部分：对文章进行总结，并再一次对该概念、中心思想进行阐述，或对相关

现象进行说明。

例文：2000 年Passage 5

If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition health, distinction, control over one’s

destiny must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition’s behalf. If the tradition of

ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it especially must be highly regarded by

people who are themselves admired, the educated not least among them. In an odd way, However,

it is the educated who have claimed to have give up on have give up on ambition as an ideal. What

is odd is that they have perhaps most benefited from ambition-if not always their own the that of

their parents and grandparents. There is heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn

door after the horses have escaped with the educated themselves riding on them.

Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly.

Summer homes, European travel, BMWs. The locations, place names and name brands may

change, but such items do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago. What

has happened is that people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily and openly as once they

could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and vulgar. Instead, we are treated to fine

hypocritical spectacles, which now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic of American

materialism with a Southampton summer home; the publisher of radical books who takes his

meals in three-star restaurants; the journalist advocating participatory democracy in all phases of

life, whose own children are enrolled in private schools. For such people and many more perhaps

not so exceptional, the proper formulation is," Succeed at all costs but avoid appearing ambitious."

The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; its public defenders are few

and unimpressive, where they are not extremely unattractive. As a result, the support for ambition

as a healthy impulse, a quality to be admired and fixed in the mind of the young, is probably lower

than it has ever been in the United States. This does not mean that ambition is at an end, that

people no longer feel its stirrings and promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is

13

less openly underground, or made sly. Such, then, is the way things stand: on the left angry critics,

on the right stupid supporters, and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to

get on in life.

这篇文章主要围绕着地质活动的热点（hot pot）理论这个概念进行讨论。

模式**3**、第一部分：提出问题，该问题涵盖了两个方面（或者更多）；

第二部分：分别对这两（或更多）个方面进行分析和论述；

第三部分：总结全文，其中包含了对以上所涉及的各个方面的概括。

例文：2001 年Passage1

Specialisation can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of

scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units, one man could continue

to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But specialisation was only

one of a series of related developments in science affecting the process of communication.

Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific activity.

No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science:

exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word 'amateur' does carry a connotation that

the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific community and, in particular, may

not fully share its values. The growth of specialisation in the nineteenth century, with its

consequent requirement of a longer, more complex training, implied greater problems for amateur

participation in science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based

especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the

development of geology in the United Kingdom.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not

simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what

constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local geological studies

represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth century, local studies

have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the

wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have continued to pursue local studies in

the old way. The overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals

harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing,

first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological journals in

the twentieth century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals have now

appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur readership. A rather similar process

14

of differentiation has led to professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two

specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in local societies or to come

together nationally in a different way.

Although the process of professionalisation and specialisation was already well under way in

British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed until the

twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned as the

crucial period for this change in the structure of science.

文章开头就提出了问题的两个方面，即科学发展的specialization（专业化）和

professionalization（职业化）。

模式**4**、第一部分：提出一个现存的需要解决问题；

第二部分：分析问题产生的原因，存在的因素以及可能的解决方案，作者可能提

到几个不同的解决方案，但是之后作者自己认可的那种方案才是文章的重点和主

题

第三部分：对问题进行总结说明并进一步强调作者支持的那种解决办法。

例文：1999 年Passage 2

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to tap the

consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies have

started to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such business-to-business sales

make sense because businesspeople typically know what product they’re looking for.

Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its

reliability. "Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them and the supplier,"

says senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are limiting the risk by

conducting online transactions only with established business partners who are given access to the

company’ s private internet .

Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available for

marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to "pull"

customers into sites. In the past year, however, software companies have developed tools that

allow companies to "push" information directly out to consumers, transmitting marketing

messages directly to targeted customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen saver

to deliver a continually updated stream of news and advertisements to subscribers’ computer

monitors. Subscribers can customize the information they want to receive and proceed directly to

a company’s Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are already starting to use similar

15

technologies to push messages to customers about special sales, product offerings, or other events.

But push technology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online culture thinks highly of

the notion that the information flowing onto the screen comes there by specific request. Once

commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction between the Web and

television fades. That’s a prospect that horrifies Net purists.

But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies to

make money. The examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show that a

Web site selling the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, hospitality, and

security will attract online customers. And the cost of computing power continues to free fall,

which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon. People looking back 5 or 10

years from now may well wonder why so few companies took the online plunge.

模式**5**、第一部分：把开头分为两段，第一段不直接进入要论述的问题和作者的观点，而是

通过一个引子展开，或讲述一个有趣的故事、或交待一些背景知识，到了第二段才

正式提出问题，因此在这种情况下考生要避免直接去第一段找主旨，而是要通过阅

读全文正确地定位主题所在段落；

第二部分：对提出的问题进行论述；

第三部分：得出结论，总结全文。

例文：1994 年Passage 2

One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They

give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country,

and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these

credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in

scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the "cashless

society" is not on the horizon—it’s already here.

While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers

too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide

range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows

businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold and how

fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the

same time these computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the most

efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also

identify preferred customers for promotional campaigns. Computers are relied on by

16

manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which

products to emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep

track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.

Numerous other commercial enterprise, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and

electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to consumers through

the use of computers.

文章第一段通篇在谈论信用卡服务的优点，而第二段的第一句话才是主题句，指出了使

用计算机的便利，因为信用卡的便利正式由于计算机技术的发展和普及带来的。

模式**6**、第一部分：提出问题，作者将要对该问题的存在进行指责和批判；

第二部分：从各个方面或者各个层次对问题进行反驳；

第三部分：指出问题存在根本原因、可能带来的后果、相应的改进措施、或者正

确的看法和观点等。

例文：这类反证类的文章至今还没有在考研真题中出现过，但是考生应该对这种模式有所了

解。

此外，考研阅读理解的文章一般都会有比较清晰的行文脉络，掌握这些规律也会有助于

对文章整体的把握，甚至还可以帮助考生预见文章中可能会出现的观点和发展方向。

常见的行文脉络有以下几种：

􀂾 一般——具体：文章开头先提出一个总的抽象的概念或者观点，接下来的各个段落具体

说明第一段的观点，把抽象的概念具体化到一些事件上。

􀂾 具体——一般：文章开头提出一个具体的问题或者事件，接下来几段从各个方面分别说

明，最后一点进行总结并把观点抽象到一般的层面。

􀂾 时间顺序：这种行文脉络出现在自然科学类的文章中比较多，一般通过时间先后顺序来

说明某一种理论的发展或者某一项研究的进展程度。

􀂾 对比：这类文章的主要目的目的在于对比两种观点、两个事物的共同点或者差异等。

二、阅读理解**A** 题型透析

阅读理解A 部分主要考查考生理解文章主意要义、具体信息、概念性含义，进行

有关的判断、推断和引申，以及根据上下文推测生词词义等的能力。以2007 年和2008 年

阅读理解文章为例，其考查的大纲要求的8 项能力（第1 页）分别归纳如下：

18

从上表分析这两年的出题趋势，可以看出现在的出题重点开始向考查各种能力组合的方向发

展，即一道题目同时考查几种能力，并且侧重于考查文章深层次的含义、以及对于文章结构

和论证过程的理解能力，而不仅仅限于文章内容字面意思的考查。

本书根据考研大纲和历年考试真题，把历年的考试题型分为以下五大类：中心思想题、

情感态度题、猜词题、细节题和推理判断题。五大题型在近13 年的考研英语阅读理解的试

题中分布如下表：

中心思想题情感态度题猜词题细节题推理判断题

2008 3 0 1 9 7

2007 2 1 1 11 5

2006 1 3 4 5 7

2005 1 2 3 11 3

2004 1 3 4 9 3

2003 2 2 2 10 4

2002 1 1 2 11 5

2001 3 1 1 13 2

2000 2 0 0 14 4

1999 1 1 0 11 7

1998 3 1 3 11 2

1997 1 2 2 11 4

1996 2 1 3 12 2

1995 0 2 3 11 4

1994 3 0 4 9 4

1993 1 1 1 12 5

合计27 21 34 170 68

比例8.4% 6.6% 10.6% 53.1% 21.2%

19

从上表中我们可以看出，细节题是考查最多的题型，约为8-11 题，占每年题型比重的50%

以上。这类题型只要细心从原文查找不难选出正确答案，也是考生拿分的基本保证。其次是

推理判断题，每年差不多有4-7 个题，约占总题数的四分之一强。这种题型重点考查考生比

较深层次的英语理解和分析能力。这两种题型在数量上的较大倾斜说明了考研命题更加注重

考生的推理判断能力以及把握文章细节和内涵的能力，而这两种能力都是建立在考生的阅读

能力之上，因此考生应该在平时的练习中应该注重相关能力的训练和提高。接下来出现较多

的是猜词题，这种题型重点在于考查考生通过上下文来猜测词语、词组或者句子的意思，属

于相对比较容易拿分的题目。主旨题和态度题的数量都比较少，每年都约有1-2 道题，出现

的频率比较稳定，而且几乎每年都会有这两种题型。主旨题要求考生能够把握文章全局结构，

有一定的难度，但是只要能够读懂文章也不难选出正确答案。而态度题的难度相对更大，因

为很多文章中作者自身的态度隐蔽在文字背后，需要考生对于英语有着较强的敏感性。但是

态度题数量比较少，即使不慎丢分，也不会影响大局。因此，考生应当对这五种题型的重要

程度有着充分的了解，从而在平时的练习和考试中能够合理分配自己的时间和精力，保证做

题的速度和效率。

关于这五大题型的命题透析，请具体参考本书以下各个部分。

三、阅读理解**A** 全功略

在这一部分中，我们将从做如何阅读理解题的微观方面和平时如何进行宏观复习两个方

面全方位地为考生定制一套复习攻略。这部分涉及到的各种方法基本都是在一些理论层面

上，考生应该把本部分的方法论和自己平时的训练结合起来，即理论和实践相结合，才能够

达到最好的效果。因此，考生应该在这个复习过程中反复阅读和研究这些方法，尝试着用到

自己的练习中去，从而探索出一套最适合自己的做题步骤和复习方法。每次做了一个阶段的

练习之后，再回过头来研究方法，相信考生每次都能够得到新的体会和灵感。

（一）、做题基本**“**三步走**”**

考研阅读理解的做题顺序一般都是以下三个步骤，即阅读全文、审题并定位原文、最后

选出正确答案。我们建议考生如果没有一套自己独创的并且适合自己的方法时，应严格按照

以下步骤进行，只有这样才能保证做阅读理解选择题的精确性。

在时间安排上，一般分配给每篇文章的总时间平均为16-20 分钟，考生可以根据文章的

难度自行调整时间的分配，在相对简单的文章上节省出几分钟、匀给相对难度较大的文章（考

20

生要记住在考研的过程中必须分秒必争，每一分钟都是一段很长的时间，要充分加以利用，

绝对不能浪费！）。具体到每一篇文章的时间分配，一般阅读文章的时间和做题时间应该相

当，即每部分的时间约为8-10 分钟。如果在阅读过程中花费太多的时间去斟酌文章字里行

间的深意，这样虽然可以帮助考生更好地理解文章、在一定程度上提高做题的精确程度，但

是往往会花掉太多的时间，影响后面的做题。相反，如果阅读过快，则考生对于文章的主旨

和细节的印象都太模糊，到做题的时候或者容易凭借印象选择错误的答案，或者做题是花太

多的时间回去原文找答案、反而浪费更多的时间，所谓“欲速则不达”。因此，考生在平时的

练习中要养成合理分配时间的好习惯。

第**1** 步、纵览全文

做阅读理解题的第一步就是要纵览全文，掌握要义，这是做题的前提和基础。需要注意

的是，考生在阅读过程中既不能太钻牛角尖弄懂每一个词和每一句话意思，又要保证自己能

够充分理解大义。这个程度的把握是非常微妙的，需要经过许多的练习才能根据自己的实际

情况具体把握。在阅读文章的过程中，应该遵循以下原则：

阅读原则一：有一支不闲着的笔。在第一次阅读文章的时候，考生千万不要以阅读休闲文

学作品的心态去看待文章，而一定要充分调动自己所有的感官集中精力去阅读，而且手也不

能闲着，在考试时带上几支好用的铅笔，随时在文章中做标记，标记的形式可以随意、以自

己习惯为好，这样以便于在做题的时候能够快速定位文章对应内容，节省了寻找的时间。

阅读原则二：抓住重点部分。在总论的第一部分，我们提到了阅读理解命题的13 大考点，

这些考点对应的文章部分就是其重点部分。首先，要重视首末段，尤其是首段，因为一般文

章的主旨就出现在首段，是出题频度相当高的一个段落。最后一段中可能会有作者的总结论

述，因此也与文章的中心思想紧密相关。其次，要在每个段落的第一句话上放慢速度、仔细

研读，因为段落的首句一般都是该段主要意思的概括，考生应该在相关内容上做好标记。此

外，如果碰到长难句，考生也要做好相应的标记，因为长难句也是出题的高频处。最后，在

阅读过程中要格外注意涉及到作者态度的内容，及时标出其位置，以便正确把握态度题的选

项。

阅读原则三：抓住关键词语词组。所谓关键词语和词组也涉及到了命题的13 大考点，即涉

及列举、举例、引用、因果关系、转折、对比、类比、数字和年代、专有名词、特殊标点符

号、最高级和绝对性词汇等。具体的一些标志性词汇请参见上文，在这里就不赘述，考生但

凡遇到这次兴奋点应该保持敏感性、及时做上标记。

需要特别注意的是，关于专有名词，如人名、地名、机构名称、书籍文章影视作品的名

称等，考生不需要用太多时间去理解其每一个词的意思，只要做上标记到时候能够找到即可。

21

有时候一些专有名字非常长而且包括了很多生词，如一些地名和机构的名称，在阅读过程中

可以考虑跳过以加快速度。

阅读原则四：不畏生词。考研阅读理解的文章中总是会出现考生不认识的单词，即使考生掌

握了所有的大纲词汇，也会有一些超纲词汇的出现。考生千万不要因为读不懂一些单词就望

而生畏，产生挫折感。有一些词语不认识并不会影响对全文的理解，有一些则可以通过上下

文、背景知识、以及构词法等猜出意思。因此，在阅读过程中遇到不认识的单词只要做简单

的分析猜测词义或者跳过即可。

第**2** 步、快速审题

所谓的“快速审题”要求考生保持速度又要有非常细心的态度，在审题的过程中抓住题干

的关键词，以方便去原文中定位相应内容。这些关键词可能与就是原文中用到的词语，或者

是原文的同义词，考生注意应该加以辨析。在遇到态度题的时候，应该要分清题干问的是作

者本人的原因，还是文中的某种态度（不一定是作者的态度）。在遇到涉及原因的题目是，

一般问的都是主要原因，即main reason or major reason，考生不要纠缠于细枝末节，要从总

体上把握。

第**3** 步、精确答题

在读完题干和选项后，有些考生会立即作答，但是由于只是凭借第一次阅读后的模糊印

象选择答案，因此往往容易被选项中的干扰项所蒙蔽、出错率较高。考生在作答是如果不是

百分之百的确定自己选择的是正确答案，一定要回到原文进行定位，将问题与原文进行比较，

找出最符合原文意思的选项。关于每一种题型如何进行精确答题，我们下面简单地一一讨论。

􀂾 中心思想题：在总论中，我们已经强调多次，一篇文章的中心思想部分一般出现在首段

或者尾段，考生只要去这两个段落定位即可，加上自己第一遍阅读的印象，得出正确答

案是比较容易的。如果文中的主旨句比较模糊，考生可以快速阅读首段和其他段段落的

首句得出文章的中心思想。

􀂾 情感态度题：态度题的数量很少，难度也较大，即使做错也不会影响大局，但是也要保

证尽量拿分。态度题一般没有具体的句子或者段落对应，但是如果考生在第一次阅读文

章的过程能够标出表示作者感情态度的词语（或者文中其他人的态度），在做题的时候

再略读相应的内容，就会有助于正确判断字面背后隐藏着的态度。

􀂾 猜词题：这类题型的题干中一般都会给出词语的出处，考生只要找到原文对应的词及其

上下文，就能够推断出该词语的意思。一般对这些词语进行解释的内容为，该词前后的

同位语、宾语从句、定语从句、以及位置并列的词组句子等。有时候考查的词语是一个

平时经常使用的词语，此时一般命题的目的都在于考查常用词语的不常用用法，那么在

22

选项中出现了该词的平常意思就一定是错误答案（比如abandon 这个词平常的意思是

“放弃，遗弃, 丢弃”，而这个词有一个不常用的意思是“放肆, 放纵; 沉湎于”，这个时候

就有可能考查后一种涵义）。总之考生一定可以在原词周围找到解释的内容。

􀂾 细节题：这类题型是阅读理解中出现最多的题型，考生应该争取拿到细节题的所有分数。

做好细节题的关键在于快速准确地定位原文，因为细节题对应的一般就是原文的一句

话、或者长句的一部分、甚至是一个词组、以及关键词的同义词和近义词。只要考生能

够正确定位，选出正确答案还是比较容易的。

􀂾 推理判断题：推理判断题虽然考查考生对于文章逻辑的理解能力，但是考生也不用担心，

因为这类题型涉及到的题型都是最简单的逻辑关系，即语言上的逻辑关系而不是深层思

维上的逻辑关系，因而是一般人都能够掌握的逻辑能力。推理题经常运用的命题方法就

是对句子或者意群的同义替换，即把原文一句话的说法用另一种方式进行表述，而意思

是一样的。但是在这种paraphrase 的过程中，一些看似不起眼的小词的变化可能就成为

了干扰选项，特别是最高级和绝对性词汇的变化，比如把“often”变成“all the time”等。

一般推理判断题的选项中，形式上与原文最接近的往往不是正确答案，而要读懂每一个

选项的具体意思。

（二）、阅读方法和技巧

**1**、三种常见阅读方法的介绍

􀂾 精读法：精读法是指对全文全面而系统的掌握。在词汇的层面上，通过一些工具如字典

等理解并掌握文章中的每一个生词的意思和用法。在句子的层面上，如果遇到了结构复

杂难以理解的长句，要通过语法知识对句子的结构进行完整的分析，首先理出主谓关系，

然后逐步分解句子的其他部分。在篇章的层面上，要认真研究通篇文章，对全文的中心

思想有一个精确的认识，并且文章的每一个细节，同时还要了解与文章相关的一些背景

知识。当然，这种方法并不适合应试，而主要适用于平时的英语学习。考生在考研复习

的过程中要把精读和泛读结合起来，对一些重点文章、尤其是考研真题文章进行精读学

习，才能从根本上提高自己的能力。关于如何研读真题，下文将有更详细的介绍。

􀂾 扫读法：扫读法是指在阅读文章过程中只寻找那些重点信息阅读，如只找与阅读题题干

相关的部分进行阅读，从而快速定位关键信息，而略过其他的内容。这种方法有较大的

难度，适用于英语水平和能力较高的考生，一般考生要谨慎使用。因为扫读法要求考生

能够在短时间内快速扫过一篇文章的所有段落，如果没有对于英语足够的敏感性，则有

限不仅找不到有用的信息，还很可能略过了一些关键的内容。考生可以尝试一些这种方

法看看是否适用于自己，但是在考研实战中还是谨慎为好。

23

􀂾 跳读法：跳读法是指以一般的顺序从头到尾地阅读一篇文章，但是在阅读的过程中速度

并不一致，而是有快有慢。读到文章的重要部分时，可以减慢速度；而读到一些无关大

局的细枝末节时，则快速跳过。前文已经较为详细地介绍了文章中应该重点阅读的内容，

下面我们在简单说明一下可以省略和跳过的内容。

􀂄 不影响大局的陌生词汇：这一点我们在前文已经强调过，即一些考研阅读文章中出

现的超纲词汇并不影响对文章的整体理解，因此在阅读过程中可以跳过。

􀂄 冗长的人名、地名、机构名等专有名词：当专有名字作为考点的时候，它主要考查

的是与此相关的一些内容，比如某个人的观点、在某地发生的事情、某机构的举动

等等，而至于这些名称具体的内容其实无关紧要，有时候这些名称长达好几个词，

考生基本上可以用一个字母来代替这次名称，后者标记上这些名称出现的位置，如

果题目中出现这些名词则方便查找。

􀂄 并列多项的列举内容：在前文我们强调了例证的重要性，这个我们这里说的列举是

不同的。例证一般都是对一个例子的详细描述，用以佐证作者的观点，因而对于理

解文章比较重要。而并列多项的列举一般都是相对次要的内容，而且列举的内容一

般都超过了三项，比如以such as， e.g. 等开头的一些列举。这些内容一般都是对

前文的具体说明，因此可以跳过。

􀂄 某些举例处：举例通常是对抽象论证的补充说明，具有一定的重要性。尤其是当读

者较难理解前文的抽象论述时，能够帮助读者得到更加具体生动的理解，因此应当

引起考生的高度重视。但是如果考生在阅读文章时已经能够较好地理解抽象概念，

那么在阅读具体例子是可以跳过或粗粗读过并做上标记，以节省时间，待做题是遇

到对应题目在回过来细读。

**2**、阅读顺序

一般的阅读顺序为：阅读文章——浏览问题——在文章中定位并确定问题答案，这也是

我们一直倡导的较为保险的做题方法。但是，因为每个人都有不同的阅读思路和习惯，因此

考生可以根据自己的采取情况采取不同的办法。常见的一些阅读顺序还有以下几种：

顺序一：在阅读文章之前先浏览题目的题干，大致了解考查哪些题型以及重点，接

着阅读文章，在阅读过程中牢记题目并随时画出重点，之后直接做题。这种阅读做题顺序的

优势在于在读文章的过程中带着问题去读，因此对文章相关部分会更加敏感，做题的精确度

也更高。但是这种方法因人而异，对一些考生来说可能要花费比较多的时间，因为他们先要

读题目，之后读文章，再之后做题时因为不确定又返回原文找答案，反而导致步骤更加繁琐。

采用这种方法的考生要注意，一开始只需要阅读题目的题干，千万不要读所有的选项，一来

费时间，二来那些干扰选项可能还会影响阅读文章时的正确理解。

24

顺序二：直接以问题为切入点，并不阅读全文。每做一道问题，回到原文用扫读法

寻找答案。这种方法的优点在于节省时间，但缺点在于考生无法对全文有一个宏观的了解，

只见树木不见森林，因此在中心思想题上容易出错。此外，对于细节题的把握也有可能因为

对文章的不熟悉而定位错误，从而选出错误的答案。这种方法对考生的扫读能力和整体英语

阅读能力的要求颇高，考生应当谨慎使用。

顺序三：不读文章，只做题目。这个手段只有在时间紧迫、万不得已的情况下才能

采用，此时考生由于没有时间来阅读全文，只好凭猜测和自己平时的积累以及背景知识来勉

强做题。一般情况下不建议采用这种做题顺序。

**3**、克服不良阅读习惯

阅读习惯对于提高阅读的速度和效率也有比较大的影响。考生在平时的练习中应该

要注意养成良好的阅读习惯，尤其需要克服以下问题：

1、母语译读：许多考生没有养成良好的英语思维习惯，在阅读英语文章的过程中

习惯在脑子里先把文章翻译成中文进行理解，这样既影响了阅读速度，又可能造成理解的偏

差和错误，是考生一定要避免的。解决方案就是要养成用英语进行直接阅读和思考的习惯，

可以通过平时多阅读英文文章（包括英文报刊杂志、英文小说等休闲读物）、多收看英文电

视节目和收听英文广播节目，来给自己造成一个英语的氛围，从而形成英语思维习惯，提高

阅读效率。

2、手指划读：很多考生无论是在读中文还是读英文的时候，都习惯用手指或者笔

指着每个单词一个一个地读，这样会严重影响眼睛扫视文章的功能，从而减慢阅读速度。考

生要练习离开自己的手指和笔，用眼睛扫读文章的习惯，从而提高阅读速度和效率。

3、轻声朗读：有一些考生阅读文章时只有读出来才能理解，而看的时候却一头雾

水，因此即使在考生的时候也要轻声朗读。这样不仅在考试过程中会影响其他考生，而且还

会被误以为是在作弊。同时，由于要把每一个单词都读出来，也影响了阅读的速度。因此考

生要在平时练习中放弃这个习惯，学会默读。

4、摇头阅读：有的考生习惯在阅读文章的时候头随着视线的移动而移动，尤其是

换行的时候，头转动的幅度更大。这种习惯不仅使人很容易产生疲劳状况，也会影响到阅读

文章的速度，应该予以纠正。

5、重复阅读：有的考生在阅读文章的时候，一旦没有读懂一个单词或者一个意群

就会不断地回到句子开头重新读、并反复地琢磨整句话的意思以达到透彻的理解。这个习惯

却是考研阅读的大忌，因为这不仅仅限制了阅读的速度，更重要的是如果考生养成这种习惯，

就会影响对于英语文章理解的整体效率，不仅影响到应试结果，而且对考生长期英语能力的

25

培养都有较大的负面影响。大家平时在阅读中文文章的时候即使有部分内容不理解也可以顺

利地继续往下读，读英文也是一样，因此如果有类似的重复阅读习惯就一定要纠正过来。在

对每篇文章进行第一次阅读时，尽量做到一气呵成。

**4**、攻克长难句

长难句是阅读过程中的重点和难点，也是考生经常感到无所适从的地方，但长难句恰恰

是命题的重点区域，因此不可小觑。其实，对付长难句的办法也很简单，就是八个字“化繁

为简、找出主干”。与汉语行文松散的结构不同，英语中每一个完整的句子都必须严格地遵

守语法习惯，由“主语+ 谓语”这个基本结构构成。因此在阅读长难句的时候，考生应该首先

找到这个句子的主谓（宾）结构，其余的成分包括定语从句、宾语从句、同位语、插入语、

定状补语等可以一概略过。这个时候就剩下了一个干净简单的句子，这个主局一般都能够说

明句子的大意。在主句的基础上，考生在逐步地把句子的其他部分和主干句联系起来，分析

并理清其中的关系，这个时候就该长句就会比较容易理解了。

例：Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science

about global warming is incomplete, that is OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know

for sure.

[2005 年真题Text 2]

首先，我们应该找到这个句子的主干，即“voices now come from many quarters …”，insisting

是一个现在分词，作为伴随状语描述voices，其后跟随了两个用that 引导的宾语从句。在第

二个宾语从句中，还包含了一个以until 引导的时间状语从句。在经过这么一番分析之后，

这个看似复杂的长句的结构和意思就一目了然了。

例句译文：正如对待吸烟问题一样，现在来自许多方面的声音都坚持认为关于全球变暖的科

学研究还不够充分，并且认为在得到确切的证据之前，我们都可以继续向大气中排放废气。

（三）、如何研习真题

很多考生都会有一个同样的问题，那就是如何在最短的时间内最大幅度地提高自己的英

语阅读能力？提高阅读能力是否有捷径？有人认为要提高应试阅读能力就应该不停地做各

种考研练习题，所谓“熟能生巧”；有人认为阅读能力的提高需要一个长期积累的过程，所谓

“一口吃不成一个大胖子”。这里我们重点要讨论的是，如何在较短的时间内提高应对考研英

语阅读题的能力。笔者认为，孙子有云：“知己知彼，百战不殆”，最好的方法就是了解和研

习历年阅读真题，找准并吃透其中的规律，把握考研阅读文章的精妙之处。个中原因有诸多，

首先，真题文章都是经过了命题专家的千挑百选，其内容和难度都保持在一个比较均匀的水

26

平；其次，为了保持一定的稳定性和延续性，考研真题文章每年在难度和类型上的变化都不

是特别大，有较好的连贯性，因此也便于考生把握和预测来年考研的文章类型和难度、甚至

和题目类型；最后，考研真题文章在语言和结构上都非常规范，足以作为考生平时练习的范

文，无论对于阅读还是写作能力的提高都有较大的帮助，经过认真的学习可以提高考生的整

体语言能力。

所谓的研习真题，并不是说把历年的真题都做一遍就行了。其实只这一步远远不够，考

生应该把历年的真题文章当作范文、或者课文，用上文提到的精读法来进行学习，对这些文

章的词汇、句子、段落和篇章都要进行深入地研究，只有这样才能找到并总结出普遍的规律，

从根本上提高英语阅读的能力。因此，本书的主要部分也都是以分析历年真题为重点，涵盖

了从1993 年至2008 年的所有真题，每一道题目都提供了详细的题解和分析，每一篇文章和

题目都给出了精确的译文，为考生打造了一套全方位、深入透彻的真题透析大全。

笔者在此总结出了一套研习真题的方法和步骤来与广大考生共享：

1、在复习初期，选择几套真题（注意：不要一口气做完所有的真题），进行预热型练

习。在做真题的时候要严格计时，每篇文章大约用16-20 分钟时间，要从一开始就掌握好时

间规律。做题时尝试用以上提到的一些方法和顺序，练习做笔记的习惯。

2、不要做完一篇文章就对答案，而是做完一套真题的四篇文章之后才一齐对答案。此

时不要急于去读相关题解，而是首先对照原文和正确答案思考自己对错的原因，重点考查自

己为什么会做错，一般都错在哪种题型上，错误的原因是什么，做一个简单但是全面的分析。

3、精读文章，找出文章中至少5 个长难句，练习对这些长难句进行结构上的分析，找

出主干，理解主干和句子其他部分之间的逻辑联系，并试着在心里翻译这些长句的大概意思。

之后对照本文给出的译文，看看自己的分析和翻译是否正确，找出存在的问题和差距。

4、阅读本文提供的题解和文章译文，总结出自己比较容易出错的题型，对照自己的解

题思路和题解中的解题思路的差别，从而发现自己的思路中存在的一些普遍的问题，及时纠

正。我们建议考生最好能够准备一个专用的本子，把自己做错的题目都记录下来、做一个备

份。

5、重新阅读文章，找出所有不认识的单词，使用权威字典察看这些单词的意思和用法，

并把它们都记在一个专用的单词本上，用平时的时间对这些单词加以记忆。我们经过对考研

历年文章的研究后发现，许多考研文章中的生词出现的频率相当高，因此考生应该把这些单

词都加到自己的词汇库里面，从而更加丰富自己的词汇量。

27

6、此外，考生还要对考研文章涉及到的领域和知识有更多的了解，因为这些文章通常

涉及到一些比较热门的领域，今后考到相关领域的可能性也比较大。积累更多的背景知识将

有助于理解文章和快速做题。

7、在完成这个阶段的真题练习之后，考生应该对自己进行各个题型的专项训练。本书

把所有的考研真题题目都根据题型作了具体的分类，考生应该在这个阶段利用这些练习重点

训练自己比较不擅长题型的做题能力，有的放矢地提高能力

8、在完成了分题型训练之后，再回到整套的真题练习，把自己以前做过和没有做过的

真题都混合在一起，每次依旧掐时间练习，如果有余力可以适当减少每篇文章的做题时间。

对于以前没有做过的文章再按照第2-6 步的方法进行精读，同时也要保持错题纪录。此外，

对于以前做过的真题，把这次的错题和上次的错题进行对照，看看自己是否有进步，另外还

存在着什么问题。

9、在考研前一个月把所有的题型按照年代顺序再重新做一遍。有考生也许会质疑不断

地做自己做过的题目是否有效果，但是实践证明做真题能够有效地帮助考生发现自己存在的

问题。有些考生第一次做错了一个题目，对照了答案之后自己以为已经理解了错误的原因，

实则一知半解，因此第二次、甚至第三次做题的时候依旧犯同样的错误。不断地做真题能够

让考生真正发现自己的问题所在，从而对自己所有的错误都做透彻的分析，对自己所有的弱

点有充分的了解，因而可以针对自己的劣势进行重点复习。

（四）、提高基本功

考研阅读理解所考查的英语能力并不是考生一朝一夕就能够练就的，而是需要长时间的

积累。因此，考生做好要考研的决定并开始准备的时候，就要给自己制订一个详细而且长期

的计划来提高英语方面的基本功，这才是从根本上提高英语阅读能力（也包括其他的能力、

如听说和写作能力等）的办法。对于阅读理解来说，其基本的三个板块在于词汇、句子和篇

章三个部分，考生应该分别从三个方面训练来提高自己的基本功。

**1**、词汇

词汇是构成语言的基本元素，因此，考生如果没有掌握足够的词汇量，在阅读过程中到

处碰到生词，就会严重限制阅读的效率和自己的信心。按照大纲的要求，通过大学英语四级

考试的考生应该熟练掌握4200 个单词、包括2000 个复用式单词，此外，精读单词总量应达

到30，000 个单词，泛读单词则至少为12，900 个单词。通过了大学英语六级考试的同学熟

练掌握的词汇量为5500 个单词、包括3000 个复用式单词。考研英语大纲规定，考生应能够

掌握约5500 个单词和词组，并能够自行掌握涉及个人好恶、生活习惯、宗教信仰，以及与

28

本人工作或专业等相关的特殊词汇。但是，考研大纲词汇规定的单词虽然在数量上和六级大

纲单词相当，但是在难度上却大大超过了六级单词。所以考生一定要早早地开始背诵大纲单

词，并争取熟练掌握95%以上的大纲单词。此外，考生也不要局限于大纲的词汇量，要尽

可能的扩大自己在各个领域的词汇量，这样才能为做好考研阅读理解题打下坚实的基础。

很多考生有这么一个误区，就是死记硬背是背单词的最有效办法，实际上这是最没有效

果的一个办法。考生想要牢记自己背过的单词，就一定要找到有效的词汇学习方法。在这里

我们对考生如何有效地背诵单词提出了一些建议：

（1）首先，怎样做才算是背单词，背单词到底有哪些步骤呢？传统上，很多考生

认为背单词就是记住一个英文单词的中文意思就可以了，其实这仅仅是第一步，还远远不够。

背一个单词，不仅要了解其中文解释，最好还要了解其英文解释，这是因为中英文毕竟是相

差非常大的两种语言，很多英文单词在中文中其实都没有确切的对应单词，因此一个英文单

词的英文解释是最准确的。此外，考生还应该通过例句进一步地了解这个单词的各种用法，

获得具体的印象。最后，考生还应该了解这个单词的同义词和近义词，并将它们进行比较，

重点考查它们之间一些微妙的区别，从而真正掌握这个单词的意义和用法。

（2）因此，为了给自己打好一个坚实的词汇基础，考生应该选取一本较好的词汇

书，书中不仅包括了中英文释义，还有翔实的例句、以及对同义词和近义词的比较说明。另

外，考生还应该随时备好一至两本权威的英文字典以便于随时查阅，笔者比较推荐的词典是

《牛津高阶英语双解词典》和韦伯斯特（Webster）系列的词典，它们分别是学习英式英语

和美式英语的权威字典。

（3）除了纯粹的背单词，考生在平时应该阅读大量的英语课外读物，尤其是与考

研阅读理解文章的文体相似相关的一些报刊杂志，前文已有列举。在阅读文章的过程中，考

生应该细心而敏锐地积累一些关于自然科学、社会科学和人文科学领域的最新词汇，从而有

效地扩充自己的词汇量。

（4）很多单词都有许多的意思和用法，考生即使背过单词也可能只记得其普通的

用法，而忘记了那些用得比较少的意义和用法。因此，考生在扩大词汇量的同时，还应学习

如何通过上下文来推断词义，这也是总论中一再强调的原则之一，即通过具体的语境来理解

某个单词或者词组的含义。

（5）猜测单词意思的能力是非常重要的。考生除了可以通过上下文的意思来推断

词语含义之外，也应该充分了解英语的构词法，尤其是各种派生词和合成词的规律。另外，

英文中的很多单词都包含了前缀和后缀，掌握前后缀的规律也可以帮助考生判断一个生词的

词性、意义以及用法等。

常用的词缀和词根表清见附录1。

29

**2**、句子

句子是表达意思的基本结构。因此，考生即使掌握了大量的词汇，但是如果不了解英语

的基本语法，没有掌握句子的构成法和规律，便依旧无法理解文章的内容。特别是考研阅读

理解重点考查对于长难句的分析能力，因此如果没有扎实的句型知识基础，会给做题带来很

大的困难。一个复杂的句子中包含的复杂语法主要包括：非谓语动词的用法、主从复合句的

用法、以及特殊句式的用法（包括省略、分隔、插入、强调、倒装、双重否定、排比句式等）。

语法基础较弱的考生应该专门找一本比较好的语法书进行系统的学习。下面将简单介绍一种

特殊句式的用法。

（1）倒装句式：一般的英语句式都是主语在前，谓语在后。但是有时候为了强调

某个意思，会将谓语的一部分或者全部提前到主语的前面，构成倒装句式。因此，倒装句式

分为全部倒装句和部分倒装句。

例1：全部倒装句

**_With economic growth_** has come centralization. (2000年Passage 4)

译文：随着经济的发展实现了居住的集中化。

例2：部分倒装句

**_No where do_** 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious

living than in the Far West. (1998 年Passage 4)

译文：1980 年人口普查的统计数字最充分地描绘出美国人迁往最西部是为了找到

更广阔的生存空间。

（2）分隔句式：分隔句式是指把在一个完整的句子中间加入其他成分，以达到进

行补充说明的作用。加入的成分可以是状语、插入语、定语从句、主语从句、同位语等等。

例：One theory, **_dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the alphabetically_**

**_disadvantaged_**, is that the rot sets in early. (2004年Text 2)

译文：按字母表顺序排名靠后的人在享受闲暇时光时凭空想出一种理论，认为这种

倒霉事老早就开始了。

（3）省略句式：省略句式是指删去句子一些重复的部分，使句子显得更加简洁。

考生应该通过语法规则找出省略的部分，否则就会影响理解。

30

例：Railroads typically charge such “captive” shippers 20 to 30 percent more than they **_do_**

when another railroad is competing for the business. (do 指代了前文的charge，2003 年Text 3)

译文：这样铁路比有竞争对象时向“受制”的承运商一般多收20%-30%的费用。

（4）强调句式：强调句式主要用来强调突出句子的部分后者全部内容，一般都是将助

动词do, does, did 提前，或者用it is,was… that…结构。

例1：Highly creative individuals really **_do_** march to a different drummer. (1994年Passage 5)

译文：极富创造性的人的确是伴着不同鼓手打出的鼓点前进的。

例2：**_It is_** not simply to raise everyone’s job **_that_** all children are legally required to attend

school into their teens. (1999 年Passage 3)

译文：法律要求所有孩子十几岁前接受教育的目的并不是为了改善他们的就业前

景。

（5）双重否定句：即一个句子中有两个否定成分，互相抵消而表达肯定的意思。相比

肯定句式，双重否定句能够起到强调句子全部或者部分内容的作用。

例：Certainly people do **_not_** seem**_less interested_** in success and its signs now than formerly.

(2000 年Passage 5)

译文：当然，现在人们对成功及其标志的兴趣似乎并为比以前减弱。

（6）排比句式：用平行的语法结构来表达类似的事物、观点等，使句子显得整齐、连

贯、有韵律感。

例：American industry **_has changed_** its structure, **_has gone_** on a diet, **_has learnt_** to be more

quick-witted. (2000 年Passage 1)

译文：美国的工业改变了结构，消除了臃肿，学会了明智。

**3**、篇章

在词汇、语法和句子的基础上，考生应该在把握篇章全局上下功夫。中国学生在阅读英

文文章的时候经常会遇到由于思维习惯不同而引起的一些困难。西方有学者曾经提出过一个

关于东西方思维差别的著名理论，认为东方人的思维是螺旋形的，一般不直接说明主体，而

是由远及近地进行描述和论证，最后指出主题；抑或全文都不说明主题，最后留有余地任读

者自己展开联想。与此同时，西方式的思维却是直线型的，即要说明一个问题就开门见山地

31

说明，之后从各个方面进行清晰地说明，最后总结出一个结论，全文是一个浑然一体的推理

过程。相比东方思维，西方思维是比较简单和清楚的，这也就是为什么我们一直强调考生要

重点抓首段和尾段、主题句、段落首句等的主要原因。

关于篇章的结构特点和阅读方法及注意事项，在上文已有详细的论述（总论第一部

分的“（六）、考研阅读理解文章的结构特点”和第三部分的“（二）、阅读方法和技巧”） ，

在这里就不再赘述。

第二章、中心思想题命题思路透析

**Part I**、命题规律透析

中心思想题，顾名思义就是考查考生是否能够把握一篇文章的主题和中心思想，是

否能够从总体和宏观的角度上把握文章的主旨大意。对于一篇说明文或者议论文来说，中心

32

思想就是文章旨在说明的事物、现象或者进行讨论和论证的问题，因此对这种整体能力的要

求使得中心思想题成为命题者每年都会出题的一种重要题型。这种题型一般数量不会很多，

每篇文章中至多出现一道题目。在考研阅读理解一篇文章的四道题目中，中心思想题一般都

作为第一题或者最后一题出现。当作为第一题时，一般相对应考查的是文章第一段的内容，

当然有的时候也有例外情况。当作为最后一题时，有可能考查最后一段的内容、也有可能考

查全文的总体情况，要视具体情况而定。这种题型的提问方式多种多样，考生应学会辨认，

同时要在平时随时训练自己概括文章中心思想的能力。

一般的中心思想题都要求考生推断全文的大意，或者采取一种迂回的方式，即问从

第一段或者最后一段中可以推测出什么。此外，还有一种形式，就是要求考生从答案选项中

选出最适合该篇文章的一个标题。这也是中心思想题的一种变化了的问法，因为一般文章标

题的功能就在于用比较简洁明了的词组来精确地概括了文章的大意。

中心思想题常见表达方式

We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes . (2006)

What does the author think of intellect? (2004)

To which of the following is the author likely to agree? (2004)

The text intends to express the idea that . (2003)

We can draw a conclusion from the text that . (2002)

From the first three paragraphs, we can learn that . (2002)

What is the passage mainly about? (2001,1994)

From the last paragraph the conclusion can be drawn that ambition should be

maintained . (2000)

The passage is mainly . (2000)

We can learn from the last paragraph that . (1999)

The passage is mainly about . (1998, 1994)

From the passage we learn that . (1997)

The passage mainly deals with . (1994)

33

其他问法还包括：

The main point the author makes in the passage is .

What does the author intend to convey through the passage?

In this passage the author , writer mainly argues that .

What does this passage mainly discuss?

The general , central , main idea of the passage is .

The passage is primarily concerned with .

The article is written to explain .

The purpose of the passage is .

This passage is intended to .

What’s the main topic of the passage?

The central conveyed in the above passage is that .

The passage tells us .

Which of the following best sum up the passage?

Which of the following statements best expresses , summarizes the main idea of the passage?

Which of the following best states the theme of the passage?

关于标题的提问方式

Which of the following is the best title for this text? (2007)

Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to convey? (2007)

The best title for the text may be . (2002)

Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? (2000)

What the author tries to suggest may best be interpreted as . (1998)

34

The best title for this passage could be . (1997)

从以上例子中我们可以看出，中心思想题的提问方式有多种多样，其中我们也可以

发现一些规律。

首先，一般中心思想题中不会出现考生不熟悉的内容，只要考生阅读了全文，就能

够把握题干的意思。

其次，题干经常会出现mainly about, best statement, central idea, primarily about 等等

的字眼。

再次，提问的方式经常以we can learn that, mainly deals with 等方式呈现。

最后，有时候题干中会指明提问的对应段落，如from the first paragraph, from the last

paragraph 等表述。以上的标志性词汇应当引起考生的注意，以便作出迅速的反应。

中心思想题常见出题位置

1、文章的第一段，经常是第一句话或者是最后一句话。

2、文章的最后一段，经常是第一句话或者是最后一句话。

3、文章中间段落的第一句话。

4、文章第一段和最后一段中出现转折词的地方。

中心思想题正确答案选项的特点

1、正确选项中通常包含了文章最重要的一些概念和词汇，这些词汇可能在文章中多次出现，

或者是文章关键词的同义词或者近义词。

2、表述不会非常绝对，而都是一些相对的描述，经常用到以下一些词汇，如：may, probably,

possible, can, could, some, sometimes, usually, often 等。

中心思想题干扰答案选项的特点

35

1、选项的表述中出现一些较为绝对的词汇，如：always, never, none, nobody, no, everyone, all

等。

2、选项中的表述犯了以偏概全的毛病，只概述了文章的某一个部分或者段落，而不是对全

文意思的总体概括。

3、选项中的表述犯了颠倒主次的毛病，把文章中并不重要的内容作为主要内容来表述。

4、选项中的表述虽然也是总体的概括，但是概括的内容过于泛泛而没有抓住文章的要义，

过于笼统，归纳过度。

5、选项中的表述与原文的意思相反或者相矛盾。

6、选项中的表述看似与原文有关系，实则把原文中没有关联的内容胡乱地联系在一起。

7、选项中的表述使用文章的关键词汇，甚至也涉及到文章的主要话题，但实际上其内容却

与原文无关。

中心思想题解题方法

方法一：找文章的主题句，即中心思想句。要抓住一篇议论文或者说明文的中心思想，首先

要快速扫描文章的第一段，找出主题句。那么选项中的正确答案往往都是对这个主题句进行

paraphrase，因此只要找出与主题句意思相符或者最接近的即可。需要指出的是，与主题句

意思最接近的选项不一定用词和原文一样，反而一些错误选项中可能包含原文的词汇。考生

要把握答案的整体句意，而不要拘泥于细节。

方法二：如果文章的第一段没有非常清晰的主题句，那么就要快速阅读文章的第一段、最后

一段以及各个段落的第一句话。根据总论中分析的英文说明文和议论文的文章结构特点，大

部分文章以及大部分段落都采用“总-分-总”的结构，因此只要把所有上述内容加起来就可以

得出文章的中心思想。

方法三：我们刚才指出的文章结构特点只是总体的情况，但并不是所有的文章都严格地遵循

那些结构原则。有的时候一篇阅读理解文章不仅没有明确的主题句，其首段和尾段也没有起

到综述的作用，同时各个段落也缺乏主题句。这个时候，考生要果断放弃寻找主题句的努力，

而是集中精力通读全文，同时在一些关键词上做上标记，在阅读完成以后通过自己对文章的

大致理解和标出的各个关键词进行综合分析，并对照题目选项。正确答案中往往包含了关键

词或者关键词的同义词或近义词。

36

**Part II**、真题解题

**1993**年**Passage 3**

When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him: he

can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.

A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by which the

inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention to the

public after that period terminates. Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a

patent extended to alter this normal process of events.

The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV

receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent’ s normal life there was

no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention.

Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the library

attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that are free for anyone to

use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent experts often advise

anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a search through live patents that the one sure

way of avoiding violation of any other inventor’ s right is to plagiarize a dead patent. Likewise ,

because publication of an idea in any other form permanently invalidates further patents on that

idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern technological

advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.

Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most "new" ideas are, in fact,

as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or

dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. The basic

patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original ideas behind

television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine

car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the rear.

41. The passage is mainly about

[A] an approach to patents

[B] the application for patents

[C] the use of patents

37

[D] the access to patents

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题有一定难度。纵观全文，作者首先提出了发明者对于其发明的东西可以用三种方式处理

其发明，引出专利这个话题。第二和三段介绍了关于专利的一些情况，而最后两段则进入了

本篇文章主要关注的一个方面，即如何得到专利的信息、以及如何把一些专利项目用于商业

用途。因此这篇文章的关注点是人们怎么样才能够取得一些获得专利权的发明的相关信息，

因此正确答案为D。

[题目译文]

这篇的主要内容是

[A] 关于取得专利的方法

[B] 关于专利的申请

[C] 关于专利的使用

[D] 关于专利的获取

**1994**年**Passage 1**

The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, marketoriented

economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their

money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen,

striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen;

and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods

and services are produce[D] Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of

individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire

of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how

resources are used to produce it.

An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer

demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this

mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to

relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short

supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated

38

from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost,

this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price

and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the

American economic system.

The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own

productive resources (private property) , and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over

natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy,

the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also

certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract

with another private individual.

54. The passage is mainly about__.

[A] how American goods are produced

[B] how American consumers buy their goods

[C] how American economic system works

[D] how American businessmen make their profits

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本文的第一句话就直截了当地说明了文章的中心思想，即“The American economic system is

organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers

largely determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for those

goods and services that they want most”（ 从根本上说，美国经济体制是围绕私有企业、在以

市场为导向的经济基础上建立起来的。在这种体制下需要生产什么在很大程度上是消费者通

过到市场花钱购买他们最需要的商品和服务来决定的），文章最后两段随即就美国经济体系

运作的两个方面进行讨论，因此正确答案为C 选项。

[题目译文]

本文的主要是关于。

[A] 美国的产品是如何生产的

[B] 美国的顾客是如何购买产品的

[C] 美国的经济体系是如何运作的

[D] 美国的商人是如何取得利润的

**1994**年**Passage 2**

One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They

give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country,

and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these

credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in

scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the "cashless

society" is not on the horizon—it’s already here.

While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers

too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide

range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows

businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold and how

fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the

same time these computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the most

efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also

identify preferred customers for promotional campaigns. Computers are relied on by

manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which

products to emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep

track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.

Numerous other commercial enterprise, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and

electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to consumers through

the use of computers.

58. What is this passage mainly about?

[A] Approaches to the commercial use of computers.

[B] Conveniences brought about by computers in business.

[C] Significance of automation in commercial enterprises.

[D] Advantages of credit cards in business.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题考察的是文章的中心思想。通过文章第二段和第三段的首句“While computers offer these

conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers too”（计算机在为消费者提供

诸多方便的同时，也给商家带来很多优势）和“Numerous other commercial enterprise, from

40

theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and

more efficient services to consumers through the use of computers”（许多其他商业企业，从剧院

到杂志社，从燃气电器公司到牛奶加工厂都通过计算机的使用为消费者提供更好、效率更高

的服务）可以看出，本文主要讨论的是计算机给商业带来的便利，因此B 为正确答案。D

选项与文章第一段有一定联系，但信用卡的例子仅仅是为了引出主要话题，并不是文章关注

的重点。而A 和C 选项都与文章强调“计算机带来的便利”这一侧重点不同。

[题目译文]

这篇文章的主要内容是什么？

[A] 计算机商业化的形式

[B] 计算机给商业带来的便利

[C] 自动化在商业企业中的重要性

[D] 商业中信用卡的优势

**1994**年**Passage 3**

Exceptional children are different in some significant way from others of the same age. For

these children to develop to their full adult potential, their education must be adapted to those

differences.

Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find ourselves describing their

environment as well. While the leading actor on the stage captures our attention, we are aware of

the importance of the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both the family and the

society in which exceptional children live are often the key to their growth and development. And

it is in the public schools that we find the full expression of society’ s understanding—the

knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the next generation.

Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that minor we can see the strengths, the

weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and the central values of the culture itself. The great

interest in exceptional children shown in public education over the past three decades indicates the

strong feeling in our society that all citizens, whatever their special conditions, deserve the

opportunity to fully develop their capabilities.

"All men are created equal.”We’ve heard it many times, but it still has important meaning for

education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used by this country’s founders to

denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to mean equality of opportunity. That

concept implies educational opportunity for all children-the right of each child to receive help in

learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that capacity be small or great. Recent court

41

decisions have confirmed the right of all children-disabled or not-to an appropriate education, and

have ordered that public schools take the necessary steps to provide that education. In response,

schools are modifying their programs, adapting instruction to children who are exceptional, to

those who cannot profit substantially from regular programs.

61. This passage mainly deals with__.

[A] the differences of children in their learning capabilities

[B] the definition of exceptional children in modern society

[C] the special educational programs for exceptional children

[D] the necessity of adapting education to exceptional children

[答案] D

**1996**年**Passage 4**

What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early America-breakthroughs such

as the telegraph, the steamboat and the weaving machine?

Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country’s excellent elementary schools;

a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums to inventors;

and above all the American genius for nonverbal , “spatial” thinking about things technological .

42

Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools our early mechanics

,especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, were generally literate and at home in

arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.

Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and inventiveness to this educational

advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 1853 reported, “With a mind

prepared by thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly into the skilled

workman.”

A further stimulus to invention came from the “premium” system, which preceded our patent

system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, originated abroad, offered inventors

medals, cash prizes and other incentives.

In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were awarded at country fairs and

at the industrial fairs in major cities. Americans flocked to these fairs to admire the new machines

and thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance.

Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the American worker took readily

to that special kind of nonverbal thinking required in mechanical technology. As Eugene Ferguson

has pointed out , “A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be reduced to unambiguous

verbal descriptions; they are dealt with in his mind by a visual, nonverbal process . . . The designer

and the inventor . . . are able to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices that as yet do not

exist.”

This nonverbal “spatial” thinking can be just as creative as painting and writing. Robert Fulton

once wrote, “The mechanic should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels, etc., like a

poet among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, in which

a new arrangement transmits a new idea.”

When all these shaping forces--schools, open attitudes, the premium system, a genius for spatial

thinking--interacted with one another on the rich U. S. mainland, they produced that American

characteristic, emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But in earlier times it meant a

friendly but competitive striving for fame and excellence.

[A]Inventive Mind

[B]Effective Schooling

**1996**年**Passage 5**

Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in the publisher’s pipelines. A

few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused and often

unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific theories for the origin and

evolution of universe and life. Cosmology , geology , and biology have provided a consistent ,

unified, and constantly improving account of what happened. "Scientific" creationism, which is

being pushed by some for “equal time” in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of

evolution are evil, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all scientists and the majority of

nonfunda mentalist religious leaders have come to regard “scientific” creationism as bad science

and bad religion.

The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At appropriate

places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. In the last three

chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He describes their

programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the extent of their

deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is

religious, one might have expected more Christian behavior.

Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness of

his arguments. The nonspecialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and

argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the creationists will be extremely

44

clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen Jay Gould says: “This book stands for

reason itself.” And so it does-and all would be well were reason the only judge in the

creationism/evolution debate.

**1997**年**Passage 4**

No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral decline of a nation. “Is this what you

intended to accomplish with your careers?” Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner executives

last week. “You have sold your souls, but must you corrupt our nation and threaten our children as

well?” At Time Warner, however, such questions are simply the latest manifestation of the soul

searching that has involved the company ever since the company was born in 1990. It’s a selfexamination

that has, at various times, involved issues of responsibility, creative freedom and the

corporate bottom line.

At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who took over for the late Steve Ross

in 1992. On the financial front, Levin is under pressure to raise the stock price and reduce the

company’s mountainous debt, which will increase to 17.3 billion after two new cable deals close.

45

He has promised to sell off some of the property and restructure the company, but investors are

waiting impatiently.

The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin has consistently defended the

company’s rap music on the grounds of expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under fire

for releasing Ice T’s violent rap song Cop Killer, Levin described rap as a lawful expression of

street culture, which deserves an outlet. “The test of any democratic society,” he wrote in a Wall

Street Journal column, “lies not in how well it can control expression but in whether it gives

freedom of thought and expression the widest possible latitude, however disputable or irritating

the results may sometimes be. We won’t retreat in the face of any threats.”

Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were signs that the chairman was

backing off his hard line stand, at least to some extent. During the discussion of rock singing

verses at last month’s stockholders’ meeting, Levin asserted that “music is not the cause of

society’s ills” and even cited his son, a teacher in the Bronx, New York, who uses rap to

communicate with students. But he talked as well about the “balanced struggle” between creative

freedom and social responsibility, and he announced that the company would launch a drive to

develop standards for distribution and labeling of potentially objectionable music.

The 15 member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin and his corporate strategy.

But insiders say several of them have shown their concerns in this matter. “Some of us have

known for many, many years that the freedoms under the First Amendment are not totally

unlimited,” says Luce. “I think it is perhaps the case that some people associated with the

company have only recently come to realize this.”

66. The best title for this passage could be _____.

[A] A Company under Fire

[B] A Debate on Moral Decline

[C] A Lawful Outlet of Street Culture

**1998**年**Passage 1**

Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is

humankind’s long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the ideal of forcing the

waters to do our bidding so fascination. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind.

Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good.

The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn’t help that building a big,

powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to assert

themselves. Egypt’s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam.

Turkey’s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.

But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example stopped the Nile

flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left - all in return for a giant reservoir of

disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.

And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized Europe,

Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam

on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of big dams. But

Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs a dam to prove itself.

Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go ahead to the even more wrong headed

Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will cause

hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the powerful, but

they are far from guaranteed.

Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of controlling water

can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are

possible without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it is hard to be

either proper, or scientifid. It is time that the world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don’t need

a dam to be saved.

**1998**年**Passage 3**

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of Gallileo’s

17th century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake’s harsh

remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism between science and the

humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.

Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore its critics

- but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have attacked “antiscience” in

several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R.Gross, a biologist at the University of

Verginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers University; and The Demon Haunted

World, by Car Sagan of Cornell University.

Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as “The Flight from

Science and Reason,” held in New York City in 1995, and “Science in the Age of

(Mis)information,” which assembled last June near Buffalo.

48

Antiscience clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find fault

primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned science’s

objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other

phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.

A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the antiscience tag has been attached to many

other groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks

of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.

Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, those manifesto, published in 1995,

scorns science and longs for return to a pretechnological utopia. But surely that does not mean

environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are antiscience, as an essay in

US News & World Report last May seemed to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science, argues

Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question

the evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other consequences

of industrial growth.

Indeed, some observers fear that the antiscience epithet is in danger of becoming meaningless.

“The term ‘antiscience’ can lump together too many, quite different things,” notes Harvard

University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science and Anti Science. “They have in

common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard themselves as more

enlightened.”

60. Paragraphs 2 and 3 are written to _____ .

**1998**年**Passage 5**

Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity known

to geologists as hot spots. Unlike most of the world’s volcanoes, they are not always found at the

boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up the earth’s surface; on the contrary, many of

them lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the hot spots move only slowly, and in some cases

the movement of the plates past them has left trails of dead volcanoes. The hot spots and their

volcanic trails are milestones that mark the passage of the plates.

That the plates are moving is not beyond dispute. Africa and South America, for example, are

moving away from each other as new material is injected into the sea floor between them. The

complementary coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the ocean are

reminders of where the two continents were once joined. The relative motion of the plates carrying

these continents has been constructed in detail, but the motion of one plate with respect to another

cannot readily be translated into motion with respect to the earth’s interior. It is not possible to

determine whether both continents are moving in opposite directions or whether one continent is

stationary and the other is drifting away from it. Hot spots, anchored in the deeper layers of the

earth, provide the measuring instruments needed to resolve the question. From an analysis of the

hot spot population it appears that the African plate is stationary and that it has not moved during

the past 30 million years.

The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role as a frame of reference. It now appears

that they also have an important influence on the geophysical processes that propel the plates

across the globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, the material rising from

deeper layer creates a broad dome. As the dome grows, it develops seed fissures(cracks); in at

least a few cases the continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, so that the hot spot

initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus just as earlier theories have explained the mobility of

the continents, so hot spots may explain their mutability (inconstancy).

50

[A] the features of volcanic activities

[B] the importance of the theory about drifting plates

**1999**年**Passage l**

It’s a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a leg slipping on your doormat.

Light up the stove and you could burn down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to

warn of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for your troubles. Or so the

thinking has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began holding more companies liable for

their customers’ misfortunes.

Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to

anticipate every possible accident. Today, stepladders carry labels several inches long that warn,

among other things, that you might-surprise! --fall off. The label on a child’s Batman cape

cautions that the toy "does not enable user to fly."

While warnings are often appropriate and necessary--the dangers of drug interactions, for

example--and many are required by state or federal regulations, it isn’t clear that they actually

protect the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. About 50 percent of

the companies lose when injured customers take them to court.

51

Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue as before, some courts

are beginning to side with defendants, especially in cases where a warning label probably

wouldn’t have changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt Sports in Illinois,

successfully fought a lawsuit involving a football player who was paralyzed in a game while

wearing a Schutt helmet. "We’re really sorry he has become paralyzed, but helmets aren’t

designed to prevent those kinds of injuries, "says Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature of the

game, not the helmet, was the reason for the athlete’s injury. At the same time, the American Law

Institute--a group of judges, lawyers, and academics whose recommendations carry substantial

weight-issued new guidelines for tort law stating that companies need not warn customers of

obvious dangers or bombard them with a lengthy list of possible ones. "Important information can

get buried in a sea of trivialities," says a law professor at Cornell law School who helped draft the

new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal community has its way, the information on

products might actually be provided for the benefit of customers and not as protection against

legal liability.

52. Manufacturers as mentioned in the passage tend to__

[A] satisfy customers by writing long warnings on products

[B] become honest in describing the inadequacies of their products

[C] make the best use of labels to avoid legal liability

[D] feel obliged to view customers’ safety as their first concern

[答案] C

[解题思路] 本题对应于文章第二段的第一句话“Feeling threatened, companies responded by

writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to anticipate every possible accident”（公司因此感到了

威胁，便做出了反应，写出越来越长的警示标识语，力图预先标明种种可能发生的事故），

可见商家极尽能事用商标来警告客户以免除自己的法律责任，因此C 选项符合题意。A 和B

选项的satisfy customers 和become honest 都不是警告标签的主要原因，而D 选项feel obliged

to …没有在原文中体现出来。

**2000**年**Passage 2**

Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males born for every 100 females,

but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice

as many women as men. But the great universal of male mortality is being changed. Now, by

babies survive almost as well as girls do. This means that, for the first time, there will be an excess

of boys in those crucial years when they are searching for a mate. More important, another chance

for natural selection has been removed. Fifty years ago, the chance of a baby (particularly a boy

baby)surviving depended on its weight. A kilogram too light or too heavy meant almost certain

death. Today it makes almost no difference. Since much of the variation is due to genes one more

agent of evolution has gone.

There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but have fewer children. Few

people are as fertile as in the past. Except in some religious communities, very few women has 15

children. Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death, has become average. Most of us

have roughly the same number of offspring. Again, differences between people and the

opportunity for natural selection to take advantage of it have diminished. India shows what is

happening. The country offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty for the remaining

tribal peoples. The grand mediocrity of today everyone being the same in survival and number of

offspring means that natural selection has lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class India

compared to the tribes.

For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived. Strangely, it has

involved little physical change No other species fills so many places in nature. But in the past

100,000 years –even the past 100 years—our lives have been transformed but our bodies have not.

We did not evolve, because machines and society did it for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe

those ignorant of evolution: they "look at an organic being as average looks at a ship, as at

something wholly beyond his comprehension." No doubt we will remember a 20th century way of

life beyond comprehension for its ugliness. But however amazed our descendants may be at how

far from Utopia we were, they will look just like us.

58. Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?

When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its

advocates are aiming at, for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles may seem

today, it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. With regard to Futurist

poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist poetry may be even admitting

that the theory on which it is based may be right, it can hardly be classed as Literature.

This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for a noise and violence and speed. Consequently, our

feelings, thoughts and emotions have undergone a corresponding change. This speeding up of life,

says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression. We must speed up our literature too, if we

want to interpret modern stress. We must pour out a large stream of essential words, unhampered

by stops, or qualifying adjectives, of finite verbs. Instead of describing sounds we must make up

words that imitate them; we must use many sizes of type and different colored inks on the same

page, and shorten or lengthen words at will.

Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little upsetting to read in the

explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on

a bridge off which they both fall into the river and then to find that the line consists of the noise of

their falling and the weights of the officers:’ Pluff! Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five kilograms.’

54

This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be classed as

Literature. All the same, no thinking man can refuse to accept their first proposition: that a great

change in our emotional life calls for a change of expression. The whole question is really this:

have we essentially changed?

[A] a survey of new approaches to art

[B] a review of Futurist poetry

Specialisation can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of

scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units, one man could continue

to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But specialisation was only

one of a series of related developments in science affecting the process of communication.

Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific activity.

No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science:

exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word 'amateur' does carry a connotation that

55

the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific community and, in particular, may

not fully share its values. The growth of specialisation in the nineteenth century, with its

consequent requirement of a longer, more complex training, implied greater problems for amateur

participation in science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based

especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the

development of geology in the United Kingdom.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not

simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what

constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local geological studies

represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth century, local studies

have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the

wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have continued to pursue local studies in

the old way. The overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals

harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing,

first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological journals in

the twentieth century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals have now

appeared aimed mainly towards either professiona

l or amateur readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to professional

geologists coming together nationally within one or two specific societies, whereas the amateurs

have tended either to remain in local societies or to come together nationally in a different way.

Although the process of professionalisation and specialisation was already well under way in

British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed until the

twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned as the

crucial period for this change in the structure of science.

53. The author writes of the development of geology to demonstrate ________.

[A] the process of specialisation and professionalisation

[B] the hardship of amateurs in scientific study

[C] the change of policies in scientific publications

A great deal of attention is being paid today to the so called digital divide-the division of the

world into the info（information）rich and the info poor. And that divide does exist today. My wife

and I lectured about this looming danger twenty years ago. What was less visible then, however,

were the new, positive forces that work against the digital divide. There are reasons to be

optimistic.

There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow. As the Internet becomes

more and more commercialized, it is in the interest of business to universalize access-after all, the

more people online, the more potential customers there are. More and more governments, afraid

their countries will be left behind, want to spread Internet access. Within the next decade or two,

one to two billion people on the planet will be netted together. As a result, I now believe the

digital divide will narrow rather than widen in the years ahead. And that is very good news

because the Internet may well be the most powerful tool for combating world poverty that we've

ever had.

Of course, the use of the Internet isn't the only way to defeat poverty. And the Internet is not the

only tool we have. But it has enormous potential.

To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to get over their outdated

anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign investment. Countries that still think foreign

investment is an invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history of infrastructure （the

basic structural foundations of a society）in the United States. When the United States built its

industrial infrastructure, it didn't have the capital to do so. And that is why America's Second

Wave infrastructure-including roads, harbors, highways, ports and so on-were built with foreign

57

investment. The English, the Germans, the Dutch and the French were investing in Britain's

former colony. They financed them. Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who owns them now?

The Americans believe the same thing would be true in places like Brazil or anywhere else for

that matter. The more foreign capital you have helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure,

which today is an electronic infrastructure, the better off you're going to be. That doesn't mean

lying down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign corporations run uncontrolled. But it does

mean recognizing how important they can be in building the energy and telecom infrastructures

needed to take full advantage of the Internet.

57．The writer mentioned the case of the United States to justify the policy of _________.

[A] providing financial support overseas

[B]preventing foreign capital's control

[C] building industrial infrastructure

[D]accepting foreign investment

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? The American Society

of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this painful question. The organization is deepsintosa

long self-analysis known as the journalism credibility project.

Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors and

spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement about what in

the world those readers really want.

But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through a set

of standard templates (patterns)sintoswhich they plug each day's events. In other words, there is a

conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-made

narrative structure for otherwise confusing news.

There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which helps

explain why the "standard templates" of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a recent

survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around the country, plus

one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned at random and

asked the same questions.

Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale

neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, and trade stocks, and they're less likely to go to

church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community.

Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work tends to

reflect the conventional values of this elite. The astonishing distrust of the news media isn't rooted

in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between reporters and

their readers.

This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a troubled

business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. Then it sponsors

lots of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why customers are annoyed

and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to noticing the cultural and class

biases that so many former buyers are complaining about. If it did, it would open up its diversity

program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by

outlook, values, education, and class.

[A] needs of the readers all over the world

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify

shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to

show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy

with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different.

If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their

secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their

disorganized bosses.

Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ convention, of a story which works well because

the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown

around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so

on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival

is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his

food and stomps over to a table by himself. “Who is that?" the new arrival asked St. Peter. “On,

that’s God," came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks he’s a doctor."

If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the

60

experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to make

a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties.

With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider

making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if

you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system.

If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural.

Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and

unforced manner. Often it’s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and

remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a

light-hearted remark.

Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote “If at first

you don’t succeed, give up" or a play on words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration and

understatements. Look at your talk and pickout a few words or sentences which you can turn

about and inject with humor.

Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster who built the

Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated

with information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the "great game" of

espionage-----spying as a "profession." These days the Net, which has already re-made pastimes

as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan's vocation as well.

The last revolution isn't simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen's e-mail. That

kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the past three or four years, the world

wide web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying. The spooks call it "open

source intelligence," and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly influential. in 1995 the CIA

held a contest to see who could compile the most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large

margin, was a tiny Virginia company called Open-Source Solutions，whose clear advantage was

its mastery of the electronic world.

Among the firms making the biggest splash in the new world is Straitford, Inc.], a private

intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the results of

spying(covering nations from Chile to Russia. to corporations like energy-services firm

McDermott International. Many of its predictions are available online at www.straitford.com.

Straifford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of mutually

reinforcing tool for both information collection and distribution, a spymaster's dream. Last week

his firm was busy vacuuming up data bits from the far corners of the world and predicting a crisis

in Ukraine." As soon as that report runs, we'll suddenly get 500 new internet sign-ups from

Ukraine," says Friedman, a former political science professor. "And we'll hear back from some of

them." Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since it can be difficult to tell good

information from bad. That’s where Straitford earns its keep.

Friedman relies on a lean staff in Austin. Several of his staff members have militaryintelligence

backgrounds. He sees the firm's outsider status as the key to its success. Straitford's

briefs don't sound like the usual Washington back-and forthing, whereby agencies avoid dramatic

declarations on the chance they might be wrong. Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its

independent voice.

42. Donovan's story is mentioned in the text to

[A] introduce the topic of online spying.

[B] show how he fought for the U.S.

[C] give an episode of the information war.

It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional Small

wonder. Americans' life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century. Failing hips can be

replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minuts surgical procedure.

Such advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was unimaginable when I entered

medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure death-and our failure to

confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.

Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal

conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a

problem to be solve[D] Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand

everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it's useless. The most obvious example is latestage

cancer care. Physicians-frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of

hope in the patient-too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

In1950, the U.S. spent .7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be billion. Anyone can see

this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars conclude that a

63

government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life

beyond a certain age-----say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted

as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty todie and get out of the way”, so that younger,

healthier people can realize their potential.

I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond, and

remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to be

53.Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is in her 70s, and former Surgeon General

Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s.These leaders are living proof that prevention

works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-

year-old, I wish to age as productively as they have.

Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. Ask a physician, I know the most

costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that people in Japan and

Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than

we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while underfunding

research on humbler therapies that could improve people's lives.

60. The text intends to express the idea that

[A] medicine will further prolong people's lives.

[B] life beyond a certain limit is not worth living.

[C] death should be accepted as a fact of life.

[D] excessive demands increase the cost of health care

[答案] C

文章第二段的前两句话都直接指出“Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to

disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as

medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved”（死亡是正常的；我们的基因决定

我们即使在最理想的环境里也会解体和灭亡。我们所有人在某种程度上都懂得这一点，但是

作为医疗消费者，我们常常将死亡视为一个可以解决的问题）。全文从头至尾也在传递这样

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet. But the 47-

year-old manicurist isn’t cutting, filing or polishing as many nails as she’d like to. Most of her

clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped

showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. “I’m a good economic indicator,” she says. “I

provide a service that people can do without when they’re concerned about saving some dollars.”

So Spero is downscaling, shopping at a middle-brow Dillard’s department store near her suburban

Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. “I don’t know if other clients are going to abandon

me, too.” she says.

Even before Alan Greenspan’s admission that America’s red-hot economy is cooling, lots of

working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships to Gap

outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who

last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious

approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last

year’s pace. But don’t sound any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not

panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy’s long-term prospects, even as

they do some modest belt-tightening.

Consumers say they’re not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own fortunes

still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, “there’s a

new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by Wall Street

bonuses,” says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied

overbidding quiets. “Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three,” says John

Deadly, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their

ability to find and keep a job.

Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for lower

interest rates. Employers wouldn’t mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers

seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary

65

ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. Getting a table at Manhattan’s hot

new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co.

may still be worth toasting.

55. To which of the following is the author likely to agree?

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the

doubters insisted that we didn't know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science

uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government

should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades,

some 10 million smokers went to early graves.

There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to

the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of

Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is definitely warming

66

and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to

protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Albert, added this key point in

the preface to the panel's report "Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us

with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base

important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future

consequences of present actions."

Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about

global warming is incomplete, that it's OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for

sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late.

With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.

Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it's obvious that a majority of

the president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they

continue to press for more research -- a classic case of "paralysis by analysis."

To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric

and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won't take the

legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by

Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for

private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of

new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is

crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.

30. The author associates the issue of global warning with that of smoking because

[A] they both suffered from the government's negligence.

[B] a lesson from the latter is applicable to the former.

[C] the outcome of the latter aggravates the former.

[D] both of them have turned from bad to worse.

Many things make people think artists are weird and the weirdest may be this: artists only job is

to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited

for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as

insipid, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s

flowers of evil.

You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen

such misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of

innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the

world today.

After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting

happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass

media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted,

lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy,

the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls

were in peril and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly

need their art to be a bummer too.

Today the messages your average Westerner is bombarded with are not religious but

commercial, and forever happy .Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling,

smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And

since these messages have an agenda--to lure us to open our wallets to make the very idea of

68

happiness seem unreliable. "Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before

we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

What we forget--what our economy depends on is forgetting--is that happiness is more than

pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss

and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone to tell

us as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that

happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It’s a message even more bitter than a

clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

36. By citing the example of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends to show that

[A] Poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music.

[B] Art grow out of both positive and negative feeling.

[C] Poets today are less skeptical of happiness.

[D] Artist have changed their focus of interest.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup

tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to

have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the

European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find

this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.

What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: [A] certain

astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; [B] winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen

capacity, which increases soccer stamina; [C. soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive

children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; [D] none of the above.

Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he

believes strongly in "none of the above." Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear

engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he

switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a

person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. "With the first subject, after about 20

hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20," Ericsson recalls. "He kept improving, and

after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers."

This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically

determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise

than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their

abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person "encodes" the

information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson

determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than

simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback

and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of

pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and

biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers.

Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated.

Or, put another way, expert performers -- whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer

programming -- are nearly always made, not born.

25. Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to convey?

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard

work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been transformed by economic risk and

new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from

solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family

economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications

of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today's

families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost

the parachute they once had in times of financial setback -- a back-up earner (usually Mom) who

could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This "added-worker

effect" could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to

help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made

up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement

income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions

71

of families who must worry about interest-rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality

that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush

campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all

of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families,

the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by

families have risen -- and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative

halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk

for families' future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as

the odds of having a weak elderly parent -- and all the attendant need for physical and financial

assistance -- have jumped eightfold in just one generation.

From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an

opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening

acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The

financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.

35. Which of the following is the best title for this text?

[A] The Middle Class on the Alert

[B] The Middle Class on the Cliff

[C] The Middle Class in Conflict

[D] The Middle Class in Ruins

While still catching-up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way

ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing

depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda,

chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.

Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affects the

stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do

males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their

ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those

of the males.

Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities”

for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much

more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater

than men’s,” she observes, “It’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they

become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”

Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that

women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are

exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds

of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by,

unfortunately, parents or other family numbers, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wearand-

tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”

Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but wad determined to finish college.

“I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my

escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later her marriage ended and she became a

single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the

car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”

Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most

women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain.

Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it

threatens your health and your ability to function.

25. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

[A] Strain of Stress: No Way Out?

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory

would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the

authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review.

Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or

decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of

the results would have to subscribe to the journal.

No longer. The Internet–and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why

commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting

access to it- is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic

Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching

74

consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and

Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made

handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now,

been a key element of scientific endeavor.

The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in

part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core

scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The

International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are

more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than

1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.

This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals

are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main institutional

subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing

agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his

employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where

organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional

repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access,

where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making

it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form

of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.

30. Which of the following best summarizes the main idea of the passage?

[A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers.

[B] A new mode of publication is emerging.

[C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication.

[D] Publication is rendered easier by online service.

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National

Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however,

he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed

dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team

uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.

The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have

generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago,

today’s people- especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many

generations- apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get

any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty

much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright

State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from

the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.

Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients –

notably, protein – to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition

and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and

adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years,

a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention, average height- 5′9 〞for men, 5′4 〞for women- hasn’t really

changed since 1960.

Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During

childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even

though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle

76

with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs.

“There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual

organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.

Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon,

senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent

of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for

basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to

predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by

and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”

35. The text intends to tell us that

[A] the change of human height follows a cyclic pattern.

[B] human height is becoming even more predictable.

[C] Americans have reached their genetic growth limit.

[D] the genetic pattern of Americans has altered.

话指出“Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon”（ 基因的最

大值可以改变，但是不要期望它们会很快地改变），因此基因模型还没有改变，D 选项错误。

第三章、情感态度题命题思路透析

**Part I**、命题规律透析

每一篇文章的作者在写作的时候，都不可避免地在文章中表达自己的情感、态度和

观点，有时候这种表达非常直接，而有的时候却又非常模糊、甚至看上去模棱两可。而考生

是否能够从作者的字里行间把握作者的情感、态度和观点则是对考生英语阅读能力的一大较

高难度的考验。情感态度题一般用于考查考生能够正确理解作者的写作意图、作者对某种现

象的看法、对某个问题或事件的观点、对所论述对象的态度。有的时候，这类题目可能避开

作者的总体态度，而考查作者对文章中提到的某个细节的观点等，这需要考生在阅读题干的

时候加以区分。一般而言，情感态度题涉及到的题目都是文章中相对有争议的问题，而且关

于态度的表述可能并没有一个明确的句子，而是分布在文章的各个角落，没有一定的规律，

因此难度也相对比较大。

从以上例子中我们可以看出，情感态度题的提问方式也有一些规律可循。

首先，题目中一般都会用到the author’s attitude 或者attitude 的近义词来进行表述。但是有

的时候考查的不是作者的观点态度，而是文中某个人的观点态度，此时都会有according to, in

the eyes of 等字样，考生应当加以区分

其次，情感态度题的词语选项一般可以分为以下几种：

（1）褒义词：positive (肯定的, 积极的), optimistic (乐观的), useful (有用的, 有益的), admiring

(赞赏的, 钦佩的), interesting (有趣的), instructive (有益的, 教育性的), enthusiastic (热心的,

热情的), supportive (支持的), support(支持), approval (赞成, 承认), approving (满意的),

confident (自信的, 确信的), impressed (留下印象的), reverent (尊敬的), polite (有礼貌的, 文

雅的)

实际的), informative (提供资讯的), persuasive (说服的), personal (个人的,), formal (正式的),

informal (非正式的), casual (偶然的), analytical (分析的)

情感态度题常见出题位置

1、文章中直接表达作者或者其他人态度的句子。

2、文章中一些感情色彩较浓的词语，尤其是形容词、动词和副词等。

3、文章的第一段和最后一段，尤其是最后一段。

4、__________文章中出现转折的地方，如nevertheless, however, but, yet 等。

5、文章中一些情态动词后面的内容，这些情态动词有should, shouldn’t, must, mustn’t 等。

情感态度题正确答案选项的特点

1、很多情况下，作者只是在客观描述一种现象或是一个观点，所以objective 作为正确选项

的频率极高。

2、一般来说，indifferent 不会正确选项，因为作者如果对一个事件漠不关心、就不会专门撰

文。另外，向cynical, disgust, deperate 等词语如果出现也不会是正确选项，因为一般考研阅

读理解所选的文章不会带有如此强烈的情感，如谩骂、攻击等。

3、如果作者开篇就提出了一个观点，而全文中有没有转折和对比的内容，一般来说作者对

这个观点持支持态度。

81

4、如果作者开篇提出一个观点或者引述了别人的观点，而后文出现重要的转折，对上述观

点进行批评后者否定，那么作者自己的观点往往与开头提出的观点相反。

5、如果选项中出现了一对反义词，那么正确答案往往是这对反义词中的一个，考生可以忽

略其余两个选项。

6、总结历年的文章，我们发现在关于社会科学和人文科学的文章中，一般来说如果作者都

会有支持的态度；在关于自然科学的文章中，作者的态度则经常是objective, analytical 等。

情感态度题干扰答案选项的特点

1、选项没有体现作者的观点，甚至是相反的意思。

2、选项中张冠李戴，把别人的观点放到了作者头上，或者把作者的观点放到了别人的头上，

要加以区分。

3、上文中提到的indifferent 及其同义词和近义词等，以及包含强烈情感的词语。

情感态度题解题方法

1、找到直接表述作者态度的句子，对应相应的选项。

2、如果没有明确表述态度的句子，则从文章的字里行间把握文章的整体基调。

3、注意不要混淆自己的态度和作者的态度，也不要混淆作者的态度和文中其他人的态度。

4、推敲琢磨文章的遣词用句，把握动词、形容词和副词所包含的情感态度。

**Part II**、真题解题

**1993**年**Passage 2**

In general, our society is becoming one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic (官僚主

义的) management in which man becomes a small , well-oiled cog in the machinery. The oiling is

done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped music, and by psychologists and

"human-relations" experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become powerless,

that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and that he is bored with it. In fact, the

blue-and the white-collar workers have become economic puppets who dance to the tune of

automated machines and bureaucratic management.

The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might find themselves out of a job;

they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest in life.

They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental realities of human existence as

emotionally and intellectually independent and productive human beings.

Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their lives are no less empty than

those of their subordinates. They are even more insecure in some respects. They are in a highly

83

competitive race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary but even more a matter

of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are tested for intelligence as well as for the

tight mixture of submissiveness and independence. From that moment on they are tested again and

again-by the psychologists, for whom testing is a big business, and by their superiors, who judge

their behavior, sociability, capacity to get along, etc. This constant need to prove that one is as

good as or better than one’ s fellow-competitor creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes

of unhappiness and illness.

Am I suggesting that we should return to the preindustrial mode of production or to nineteenthcentury

"free enterprise" capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never solved by returning to a

stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming our social system from a

bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and consumption are ends in

themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full development of his potentialitiesthose

of love and of reason-are the aims of all social arrangements. Production and consumption

should serve only as means to this end, and should be prevented from ruling man.

40. The author’s attitude towards industrialism might best be summarized as one of __

[A] approval

[B] dissatisfaction

[C] suspicion

[D] tolerance

[答案] B

[解题思路]

纵观全文，其主要基调就是表达了对目前这个工业化体制的不满，人在其中失去了个性和独

become economic puppets who dance to the tune of automated machines and bureaucratic

management”（事实上，蓝领和白领工人已经成了伴随自动化机器和官僚主义管理方式的

节奏翩翩起舞的经济玩偶）。最后一段第二句话进一步指出“I suggest transforming our social

system from a bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and

consumption are ends in themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full

development of his potentialities-those of love and of reason-are the aims of all social

arrangements”（我建议把我们的社会制度从以最大限度生产和最大限度消费为目的的官僚

**1995**年**Passage l**

Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to assist

a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable price, thereby establishing a firm home market and so

making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it

helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an

increased need for labour, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the

costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as

much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube

would cost 20 per cent more.

And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the

products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven acts of Parliament govern

the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the

promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading

advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the

inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I

know that the article does what is claimed for it , and that it represents good value.

Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can

think of.

There is one more point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television

personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs. He

was drawing excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to persuade.

If its message were confined merely to information-and that in itself would be difficult if not

impossible to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly

persuasive----advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But perhaps

that is what the well-known television personality wants.

85

54. In the author’s opinion,__.

[A]advertising can seldom bring material benefit to man by providing information

[B]advertising informs people of new ideas rather than wins them over

[C]there is nothing wrong with advertising in persuading the buyer

[D]the buyer is not interested in getting information from an advertisement

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章最后一段，该段第一句话指出“If its message were confined merely to

information-and that in itself would be difficult if not impossible to achieve, for even a detail such

as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly persuasive----advertising would be so boring that no

one would pay any attention”（如果广告内容仅限于提供信息——这件事如果不是不可能，

也很难实现，因为即使是对于衬衫颜色的挑选也具有一些劝诱性——那么广告将会变得非常

索然无味，甚至没有人会注意到它），这是对那位电视名人的反驳，因而说明作者认为广告

试图说服人们购买产品并不是一个问题，因此正确答案为C 选项。B 选项与原文意思相反，

而A 和D 选项的表述在原文中没有提及。

[题目译文]

在作者看来， 。

[A]广告几乎不能通过提供信息给人们带来物质上的好处

[B]广告诉人们的是新想法，而不是要赢得他们

[C]通过广告来说服人们购买产品并没有什么过错

[D]买东西的人对于从广告中得到信息并不感兴趣

**1995**年**Passage 5**

That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an obvious but nevertheless

remarkable activity called remembering. Learning could not occur without the function popularly

named memory. Constant practice has such as effect on memory as to lead to skillful performance

on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and understanding these words. Socalled

intelligent behaviour demands memory, remembering being a primary requirement for

reasoning. The ability to solve any problem or even to recognize that a problem exists depends on

memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street is based on remembering many earlier

experiences.

86

Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task or for any learned material.

Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and the adaptive

consequences may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting can seem to be

adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be interpreted to have survived through a process

of natural selection in animals. Indeed, when one’s memory of an emotionally painful experience

lead to serious anxiety, forgetting may produce relief. Nevertheless, an evolutionary interpretation

might make it difficult to understand how the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived

natural selection.

In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its possible aspects, it is helpful to

consider what would happen if memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids orientation in time,

since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing clues for inferring duration.

Without forgetting, adaptive ability would suffer, for example, learned behaviour that might have

been correct a decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of people who (by ordinary

standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were full of confusion. This forgetting

seems to serve that survival of the individual and the species.

Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited capacity that provides

adaptive flexibility specifically through forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are made

between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). Indeed, there is evidence that

the rate at which individuals forget is directly related to how much they have learned. Such data

offers gross support of contemporary models of memory that assume an input-output balance.

**1996**年**Passage 3**

In the last half of the nineteenth century “capital” and “labour” were enlarging and perfecting

their rival organizations on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by a limited liability

company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. The change met the technical requirements of

the new age by engaging a large professional element and prevented the decline in efficiency that

so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms in the second and third generation after the

energetic founders. It was moreover a step away from individual initiative, towards collectivism

and municipal and state-owned business. The railway companies, though still private business

managed for the benefit of shareholders, were very unlike old family business. At the same time

the great municipalities went into business to supply lighting, trams and other services to the

taxpayers .

The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business had important

consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased the

numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing

irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and almost equally

detached from the responsible management of business. All through the nineteenth century,

America, Africa, India, Australia and parts of Europe were being developed by British capital, and

British shareholders were thus enriched by the world’s movement towards industrialisation.

Towns like Bournemouth and Eastboume sprang up to house large. “comfortable” classes who had

retired on their incomes, and who had no relation to the rest of the community except that of

drawing dividends and occasionally attending a shareholders’ meeting to dictate their orders to the

management. On the other hand "shareholding" meant leisure and freedom which was used by

many of the later Victorians for the highest purpose of a great civilisation.

The “shareholders” as such had no knowledge of the lives, thoughts or needs of the workmen

employed by the company in which he held shares, and his influence on the relations of capital

and labour was not good. The paid manager acting for the company was in more direct relation

with the men and their demands, but even he had seldom that familiar personal knowledge of the

workmen which the employer had often had under the more patriarchal system of the old family

business now passing away. Indeed the mere size of operations and the numbers of workmen

88

involved rendered such personal relations impossible. Fortunately, however, the increasing power

and organization of the trade unions, at least in all skilled trades, enabled the workmen to meet on

equal terms the managers of the companies who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike

and lockout taught the two parties to respect each other’ s strength and understand the value of fair

negotiation.

**1997**年**Passage 1**

It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing and

final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia’s Northern Territory became the first legal

authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die.

89

The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the

Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to

Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group’s on line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess:

“We posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn’t just something that happened in

Australia. It’s world history.”

The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally III law has left

physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have

breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right to life groups and the Australian Medical

Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn

back. In Australia — where an aging population, life extending technology and changing

community attitudes have all played their part — other states are going to consider making a

similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US and Canada, where the right to die movement is

gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling.

Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death — probably by a

deadly injection or pill — to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally

ill by two doctors. After a “cooling off” period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of

request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54 year old Darwin

resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally III law means he can get on with

living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition.

“I’m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I’d go,

because I’ve watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,”

he says.

54. The author’s attitude towards euthanasia seems to be that of _____.

[A] opposition

[B] suspicion

[C] approval

[D] indifference

[答案] C

**1997**年**Passage 5**

Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as “steering the economy to a soft

landing” or “a touch on the brakes”, makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could be

further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain. And there are long,

variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the analogy that

likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear

view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.

Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of late.

Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its

lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way below the

double digit rates which many countries experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s.

It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists which

The Economist polls each month said that America’s inflation rate would average 3.5% in 1995.

In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and expected to average only about 3% for the year as a whole.

In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end

of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, inflation has been

consistently lower than expected in Britain and America.

Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and the

United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially America’s,

have little productive slack. America’s capacity utilization, for example, his historically high

levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen bellow most estimates of

the natural rate of unemployment — the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past.

Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a little

91

defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have up ended the

old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation.

70. The passage shows that the author is _____ the present situation.

[A]critical of

**1998**年**Passage 3**

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of Gallileo’s

17th century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake’s harsh

92

remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism between science and the

humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.

Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore its critics

- but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have attacked “antiscience” in

several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R.Gross, a biologist at the University of

Verginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers University; and The Demon Haunted

World, by Car Sagan of Cornell University.

Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as “The Flight from

Science and Reason,” held in New York City in 1995, and “Science in the Age of

(Mis)information,” which assembled last June near Buffalo.

Antiscience clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find fault

primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned science’s

objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other

phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.

A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the antiscience tag has been attached to many

other groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks

of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.

Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, those manifesto, published in 1995,

scorns science and longs for return to a pretechnological utopia. But surely that does not mean

environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are antiscience, as an essay in

US News & World Report last May seemed to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science, argues

Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question

the evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other consequences

of industrial growth.

Indeed, some observers fear that the antiscience epithet is in danger of becoming meaningless.

“The term ‘antiscience’ can lump together too many, quite different things,” notes Harvard

University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science and Anti Science. “They have in

common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard themselves as more

enlightened”

[B] subjective

**1999**年**Passage l**

It’s a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a leg slipping on your doormat.

Light up the stove and you could burn down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to

warn of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for your troubles. Or so the

thinking has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began holding more companies liable for

their customers’ misfortunes.

Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to

anticipate every possible accident. Today, stepladders carry labels several inches long that warn,

among other things, that you might-surprise! --fall off. The label on a child’s Batman cape

cautions that the toy "does not enable user to fly."

While warnings are often appropriate and necessary--the dangers of drug interactions, for

example--and many are required by state or federal regulations, it isn’t clear that they actually

protect the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. About 50 percent of

the companies lose when injured customers take them to court.

Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue as before, some courts

are beginning to side with defendants, especially in cases where a warning label probably

94

wouldn’t have changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt Sports in Illinois,

successfully fought a lawsuit involving a football player who was paralyzed in a game while

wearing a Schutt helmet. "We’re really sorry he has become paralyzed, but helmets aren’t

designed to prevent those kinds of injuries, "says Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature of the

game, not the helmet, was the reason for the athlete’s injury. At the same time, the American Law

Institute--a group of judges, lawyers, and academics whose recommendations carry substantial

weight-issued new guidelines for tort law stating that companies need not warn customers of

obvious dangers or bombard them with a lengthy list of possible ones. "Important information can

get buried in a sea of trivialities," says a law professor at Cornell law School who helped draft the

new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal community has its way, the information on

products might actually be provided for the benefit of customers and not as protection against

legal liability.

**2001**年**Passage 4**

95

The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed. The

process sweeps from hyperactive America to Europe and reaches the emerging countries with

unsurpassed might. Many in these countries are looking at this process and worrying: Won't the

wave of business concentration turn into an uncontrollable anti-competitive force?

There's no question that the big are getting bigger and more powerful. Multinational

corporations accounted for less than 20% of international trade in 1982. Today the figure is more

than 25% and growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing segment of

production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment. In Argentina, for instance,

after the reforms of the early 1990s, multinationals went from 43% to almost 70% of the industrial

production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon has created serious concerns over the role

of smaller economic firms, of national businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world

economy.

I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that

underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower trade and

investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable of meeting

customers' demands. All these are beneficial, not detrimental, to consumers. As productivity

grows, the world's wealth increases.

Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty. Yet it is hard to

imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to competition

that were feared nearly a century ago in the US, when the Standard Oil trust was broken up. The

mergers of telecom companies, such as World Com, hardly seem to bring higher prices for

consumers or a reduction in the pace of technical progress. On the contrary, the price of

communications is coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing—witness Daimler

and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan—but it does not appear that consumers are being hurt.

Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few weeks ago, Alan

Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking industry. Who is going to supervise,

regulate and operate as lender of last resort with the gigantic banks that are being created? Won't

multinationals shift production from one place to another when a nation gets too strict about

infringements to fair competition? And should one country take upon itself the role of defending

competition on issues that affect many other nations, as in the US vs. Microsoft case?

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since OPEC agreed to supplycuts

in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last

December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when

prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in

double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom

and doom this time?

The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports.

Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could

push the price higher still in the short term.

Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than in

the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of

petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price, so

even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on pump prices than in the

past.

Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in

the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy,

energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile

97

telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices)

rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest

Economic Outlook that, it oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in

1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is

less than one-quarter of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing

emerging economies—to which heavy industry has shifted—have become more energy-intensive,

and so could be more seriously squeezed.

One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s,

it has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess

demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic decline. The

Economist’s commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year ago. In 1973 commodity

prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems,

causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads

accounted for under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series of

mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the freight moved

by major rail carriers.

Supporters of the new super systems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial cost

reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by

fierce competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities

traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads

therefore have them by the throat.

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only

one rail company. Railroads typically charge such “captive” shippers 20 to 30 percent more than

they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they are being

overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government's Surface Transportation Board for

rate relief, but the process is expensive, time consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.

Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the long

run it reduces everyone's cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue,

shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so,

leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line. It's theory to which many

economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which

companies will flourish and which will fail. “Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who

wins and who loses in the marketplace?” asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who

frequently represents shipper.

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be his with a round of huge rate increases.

The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortuning fortunes. still does not earn

enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet

railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street cheering them on.

Consider the .2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail's

net railway operating income in 1996 was just million, less than half of the carrying costs of the

transaction. Who's going to pay for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will,

as Norfolk Southern and CSX increase their grip on the market.

It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional

Small wonder. Americans' life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century. Failing hips

can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minuts surgical

procedure. Such advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was unimaginable when

I entered medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure death-and our

failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.

Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal

conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a

100

problem to be solved. Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand

everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it's useless. The most obvious example is latestage

cancer care. Physicians-frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of

hope in the patient-too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

In1950, the U.S. spent .7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be billion. Anyone can

see this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars conclude

that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains

life beyond a certain age-----say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been

quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way”, so that

younger, healthier people can realize their potential.

I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond,

and remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to

be 53.Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is in her 70s, and former Surgeon General

Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s.These leaders are living proof that prevention

works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-

year-old, I wish to age as productively as they have.

Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. Ask a physician, I know the

most costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that people in

Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier

lives than we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while

underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people's lives.

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet. But the 47-

year-old manicurist isn’t cutting, filing or polishing as many nails as she’d like to. Most of her

clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped

showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. “I’m a good economic indicator,” she says. “I

provide a service that people can do without when they’re concerned about saving some dollars.”

So Spero is downscaling, shopping at a middle-brow Dillard’s department store near her suburban

Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. “I don’t know if other clients are going to abandon

me, too.” she says.

Even before Alan Greenspan’s admission that America’s red-hot economy is cooling, lots of

working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships to Gap

outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who

last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious

approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last

year’s pace. But don’t sound any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not

panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy’s long-term prospects, even as

they do some modest belt-tightening.

Consumers say they’re not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own fortunes

still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, “there’s a

new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by Wall Street

bonuses,” says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied

102

overbidding quiets. “Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three,” says John

Deadly, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their

ability to find and keep a job.

Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for lower

interest rates. Employers wouldn’t mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers

seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary

ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. Getting a table at Manhattan’s hot

new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co.

may still be worth toasting.

Americans today don‘t place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, entertainers,

and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our children to get a practical

education——not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive antiintellectualism

in our schools aren’t difficult to find.

“Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual,”

says education writer Diane Ravitch. “Schools could be a counterbalance.” Razitch‘s latest bock,

_Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms_, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our

schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for

intellectual pursuits.

But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them

vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their ideas

and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing

along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, “We will become a second-rate country. We will have a

less civil society.”

“Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor Richard

Hofstadter in Anti-Intellectualism in American life, a Pulitzer Prize winning book on the roots of

anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of our history, says

Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of

elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence have been considered more noble

qualities than anything you could learn from a book.

Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and rigorous

book learning put unnatural restraints on children: “We are shut up in schools and college

recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know

a thing.” Mark Twain‘s Huckleberry Finn exemplified American anti-intellectualism. Its hero

avoids being civilized——going to school and learning to read——so he can preserve his innate

goodness.

Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we reluctantly

admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to

grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes,

criticizes and imagines.

104

School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country‘s educational

system is in the grips of people who “joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility to intellect

and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least intellectual promise.”

58. The views of Ravish and Emerson on schooling are .

[A] identical

[B] similar

[C] complementary

[D] opposite

本文要求比较拉维奇和爱默生对于教育的各自观点，对应文章信息分别在第二段和第五段。

从第二段中可以看出，拉维奇重在批判当前学校教育中的anti-intellectualism，因此反过来说

他认为学校教育应该强调智力。而第五段的第一句指出，“Ralph Waldo Emerson and other

Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and rigorous book learning put unnatural

restraints on children”（爱默生和其他一些超自然主义哲学家认为学校教育和高强度的书本

学习会使孩子受到不自然的限制），这说明爱默生反对学校教育，即反对智力，认为那样反

而会限制孩子的发展。可见两人的观点是截然相反的，因此正确答案为D。

通读全文，可以发现作者从头到尾的口气都是赞成智力的，比如最后一段第一句就指出

“School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted”（目前学校里知识仍遭到怀疑）。现实

是intellect 被人们mistrust，实际上作者认为我们应该去追求这种品质，因而正确答案为C。

A 选项的错误在于作者认为intellect 比intelligence 更重要，这在第六段对两者的描述中有所

体现。至于B、D 选项在原文并没有涉及，也可排除。

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a

colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even

be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human”, with the underlying assumption that

other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by

Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been

published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys, which have all the

necessary ingredients to capture the public imagination. They look cute. They are good-natured,

co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their finicky female

human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services”

than males (although why this is so remains a mystery).

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr Brosnan's and Dr de Waal's study.

The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally,

the monkeys were happy enough to swap pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when

two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the

other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.

In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So

when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand

106

hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her

token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the

chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the

other chamber (in the absence of an actual monkey able to eat it) was enough to induce sullen

behaviour in a female capuchin.

Dr Brosnan and Dr de Waal report that such behaviour is unusual in their trained monkeys.

During two years of bartering prior to these experiments, failure to exchange tokens for food

occurred in fewer than 5% of trials. And what made the behaviour even more extraordinary was

that these monkeys forfeited food that they could see—and which they would have readily

accepted in almost any other set of circumstances.

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions.

In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable

only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems,

are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings

abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness

evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor

that the species had 35m years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

21. In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by

[A] posing a contrast.

[B] justifying an assumption.

[C] making a comparison.

[D] explaining a phenomenon.

[答案] C

American no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the

English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest

book, _Doing Our Own Thing_. The Degradation of language and Music and why we should like,

care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views,

sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.

Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the

decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic specialty is language history and change, and he

sees the gradual disappearance of “whom”, for example, to be natural and no more regrettable

than the loss of the case-ending of Old English.

But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing”, has spelt the death of

formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated

tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then

has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal,

performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written

English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.

Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend

that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his

subtitle, why we should, like care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human

language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive-there

exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas He is not arguing, as

many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized

poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem oldfashioned

to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not

strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms-he is really grieving over the loss of

108

something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china”.

A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.

40. According to the last paragraph, “paper plates” is to “china” as

[A] “temporary” is to “permanent”.

[B] “radical” is to “conservative”.

[C] “functional” is to “artistic”.

[D] “humble” is to “noble”.

In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for

homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the

casualness and absence of consumption” launched by the 19th--century department stores that

offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a

knowledgeable elite.” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background.

This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports

are other forces for homogenization.

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating

but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports

109

that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented level nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998

immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent .In the 10 years prior to 1990,

3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000.

Now, consider three indices of assimilation –language, home ownership and intermarriage.

The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most

common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The

children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the

original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America

as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign–born immigrants who had arrived before 1970

had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born

Americans.

Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S –born

whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-

Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian–American women are married to non-Asians.

Rodriguez note that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrant living within

the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”

Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to

have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s

social induces suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.

25. In the author’s opinion, the absorption of immigrants into American society is

[A] rewarding.

[B] successful.

[C] fruitless.

[D] harmful.

When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large

animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived, the large, slow-growing animals

were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be

happening in the oceans.

That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years what researchers such as Ransom

Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half

a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods de not attempt to estimate the

actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the

ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in

Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is

reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas,

it has halved again since then.

Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative, one reason for this is that fishing

technology has improved Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which

were not available 50 years ago that means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being

caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded

by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with

fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since to baited hooks would have

been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in

the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That

is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise.

Dr. Myers and Dr. worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future

management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among

marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline”. The notion is that people have failed to detect the

massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a

relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum

111

sustainable yield that can be cropped form a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is

about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to de

business.

[A] management efficiency

[B] biomass level

[C] catch-size limits

Many things make people think artists are weird and the weirdest may be this: artists only job is

to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited

for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as

insipid, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s

flowers of evil.

You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen

such misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of

112

innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the

world today.

After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting

happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass

media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted,

lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy,

the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls

were in peril and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly

need their art to be a bummer too.

Today the messages your average Westerner is bombarded with are not religious but

commercial, and forever happy .Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling,

smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And

since these messages have an agenda--to lure us to open our wallets to make the very idea of

happiness seem unreliable. "Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before

we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

What we forget--what our economy depends on is forgetting--is that happiness is more than

pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss

and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone to tell

us as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that

happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It’s a message even more bitter than a

clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

38. In the author’s opinion, advertising

[A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy part.

[B] is a cause of disappointment for the general peer

[C] replace the church as a major source of information

[D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself.

[答案] D

本题在文章中的对应信息为第四段和第六段。第四段最后一句话提出广告和大众文化所描述

的幸福更是一种“ideology”，一种意识形态，ideology 在这里可以等同于D 选项中的illusion

（幻觉）。第六段也指出了这种幸福感非常“unreliable”，很不可靠，因为它只是一种幻想，

113

因此D 为正确选项。A 选项中“in the wake of”是“在……之后”的意思，但却颠倒了前后

顺序，应该是反幸福艺术随着广告的出现而出现，文章在第四段中有对应信息“The rise of

anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media”，因此A 选项错误。B 与文

章意思相反，因为广告给人们创造了幸福感。

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column

called “Ask Marilyn." People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at

a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 -- the highest score ever

recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has

been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit

confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What's

the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It's not

obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to

answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.

Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be

smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from

neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?

The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests

are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-

Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children's

version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists,

although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like

vos Savant's are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population

distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age

and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)

114

and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.

Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in

school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence

Testing?", Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to

measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life

success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations

change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under

low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with

leadership -- that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that

test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.

30. What is the author's attitude towards IQ tests?

[A]Supportive

[B]Skeptical.

[C]Impartial

[D]Biased

[答案] B

纵观全文，尤其是最后一段，作者对智商测试是持怀疑态度的。像该段第一句话“Such

knowing when to guess or what questions to skip”（ 任何经历过学术能力检测的人都会认为，

第四章、猜词题命题思路透析

**Part I**、命题规律透析

猜词题是考研英语阅读理解中必考的题型，主要考查考生对于文章中的某个词语、词组、

句子等的意思的理解和猜测，其主要目的在于考察考生们的英语语言基本功。对于很多考生

来说，生词是阅读中的一大难关。在总论中我们也提过，有的考生从中学时就养成了逢生词

必查的习惯，不管阅读什么文章都要弄懂其中每一个单词的意思。这种毅力固然可嘉，但是

在实际的阅读过程中不遇到生词是不可能的，而若考生总是拘泥于搞懂个别单词的意思其实

是非常浪费时间的。且不说这种习惯在考研过程中会影响阅读的速度、效率和考生的信心，

相信所有考生在开始研究生学习之后都需要阅读本领域的大量英文文献，这些文献中往往都

有非常大的单词量，大家不可能光靠查字典解决问题。因此，猜测单词的能力对于考生的阅

读有着深远的影响，可以不夸张地说，大部分人一辈子都要在阅读的时候不断地猜测生词的

意思，因此这是一种毕生的能力。

考研英语阅读的猜词题可以大致分为四类：1、猜测某个单词的意思，这个单词有可能

是超纲词汇，也有可能是一个熟悉单词的不熟悉用法；2、猜测某个词组的意思，这个词组

116

中可能包含了某个超纲词汇，或者是一个熟悉单词的特殊搭配；3、猜测某个句子的含义，

这个句子一般结构不会非常复杂，不是长难句，但是其中可能包含了一些超纲词汇或者特殊

的词组、习语、典故、成语等，此外这个句子也可能是引自文中某个人的话；4、猜测某个

词语的指代含义，如it, this , that, which, these, those 等，或者是一个意思笼统的抑或是某个

集体名词在文中的具体含义，考生需要注意的是在做这种题时要把握答案与题干的单词在

性、数、格上的一致。

做猜词题的关键就在于通过上下文来理解所考查词语、词组和句子的含义，并且把答案

套到原文中看是否在逻辑上是否行得通。考生千万不能把题干孤立起来臆测其含义，这样的

做法会严重影响做题效率。此外，考生也要相信自己的常识和逻辑判断，一般来说作者在写

文章的时候不会背离基本的常识。

**Part II**、真题解题

**1993**年**Passage 3**

When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him: he

can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.

A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by which the

inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention to the

public after that period terminates. Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a

patent extended to alter this normal process of events.

The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV

receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent’ s normal life there was

no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention.

Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the library

attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that are free for anyone to

use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent experts often advise

anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a search through live patents that the one sure

way of avoiding violation of any other inventor’ s right is to plagiarize a dead patent. Likewise,

because publication of an idea in any other form permanently invalidates further patents on that

idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern technological

121

advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.

Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most "new" ideas are, in fact,

as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or

dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. The basic

patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original ideas behind

television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine

car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the rear.

44. The word "plagiarize" (line 8, Para. 5) most probably means _

[A] steal and use

[B] give reward to

[C] make public

[D] take and change

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题所在的原文为“Indeed, patent experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of

conducting a search through live patents that the one sure way of avoiding violation of any other

inventor’ s right is to plagiarize a dead paten”（实际上，专利专家们常对希望开发有效专利而

又想避免高额费用的人提出建议，即避免侵犯他人专利权的有效方法就是使用过期专利） 。

B 和C 选项显然与原文无关，而D 选项“change”的意思在文章中没有体现出来。在专利

过期之后，任何人都可以把这个专利或其想法和流程拿来使用而不用经过作者的同意，因此

就有“steal and use”的意思。实际上plagiarize 这个词语的意思就是“抄袭，剽窃：把（他

人的观点或文章）作为自己的使用”。

[题目译文]

“plagiarize”（第五段第八行）最可能的意思是

[A] 偷来使用

[B] 给……颁奖

[C] 使……公开

[D] 拿来并改变

**1994**年**Passage 1**

122

The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, marketoriented

economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their

money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen,

striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen;

and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods

and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual

consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of

individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how

resources are used to produce it.

An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer

demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this

mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to

relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short

supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated

from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost,

this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price

and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the

American economic system.

The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own

productive resources (private property) , and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over

natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy,

the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also

certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract

with another private individual.

51. In Line 11, Para 1, "the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes" means__.

[A] Americans are never satisfied with their incomes

[B] Americans tend to overstate their incomes

[C] Americans want to have their incomes increased

[D] Americans want to increase the purchasing power of their incomes

[答案] D

[解题思路]

123

本题词组来自于文章第一段的最后一句话“Thus, in the American economic system it is the

demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and

the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be

produced and how resources are used to produce it”（因此，在美国经济体制中，消费者个人

的需求，加上商人获取最大利润的追求及消费者想最大限度提高购买力的愿望三者共同决定

应该生产什么和如何利用资源来生产这些产品），从原句中可以看出所谓的“个人收入最大

化”其实包含着最大化收入的购买力这层意思，即可以以同样的收入买到更多的商品。分析

出这层意思后显然只有D 选项符合题意，而其他三个选项都是表面上肤浅的理解。

[题目译文]

在文章第一段第11 行中，“个人对于收入最大化的期望”的意思是。

[A] 美国人从来不满足于他们的收入

[B] 美国人往往过于强调他们的收入

[C] 美国人想要增加他们的收入

[D] 美国人想要提高他们收入的购买力

**1994**年**Passage 2**

One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They

give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country,

and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these

credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in

scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the "cashless

society" is not on the horizon—it’s already here.

While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers

too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide

range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows

businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold and how

fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the

same time these computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the most

efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also

identify preferred customers for promotional campaigns. Computers are relied on by

manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which

products to emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep

track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.

124

Numerous other commercial enterprise, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and

electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to consumers through

the use of computers.

57. The phrase "ring up sales" (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means "__".

[A] make an order of goods

[B] record sales on a cash register

[C] call the sales manager

[D] keep track of the goods in stock

[答案] B

[解题思路]

题干中的词组出现在文章第二段的第二句话“Electronic cash registers can do much more than

simply ring up sales”。文中没有直接相关的指代或解释信息，但从该句的“registers”和下

一个句子中的“keep records”等信息中可以推测“ring up”就是“登记”的意思。实际上第

二段的第二、三句话的意思是“电子收银机能做的远不止记录销售额，它们可进行各种各样

的记录，包括谁卖了什么，什么时候卖的，卖给谁了等”，因此B 为正确选项。同时也可

以将其他三个选项分别代入原句看上下文是否连贯一致，从而可以分别排除三个选项。

[题目译文]

第二段第三行中的词组“ring up sales”的意思很可能是。

[A] 制定货物订单

[B] 在现金簿上纪录销售状况

[C] 打电话给销售经理

[D] 查明储存的货物状况

**1994**年**Passage 4**

“I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we’ll know in vast detail how cancer

cells arise,” says microbiologist Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. “But,” he cautions, “some

people have the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure will rapidly follow. Consider

Pasteur. He discovered the causes of many kinds of infections, but it was fifty or sixty years

before cures were available.”

125

This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from cancer will survive at least five

years. In the year 2000, the National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 75 percent. For

some skin cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90 percent. But other survival statistics

are still discouraging-----13 percent for lung cancer, and 2 percent for cancer of the pancreas (胰

腺).

With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how cancer works is not easy. The

researchers made great progress in the early 1970s, when they discovered that oncogenes, which

are cancer-causing genes ( 基因), are inactive in normal cells. Anything from cosmic rays to

radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains unknown. If several

oncogenes are driven into action, the cell, unable to turn them off, becomes cancerous.

The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the likelihood that many cancers are

initiated at the level of genes suggests that we will never prevent all cancers. "Changes are a

normal part of the evolutionary process, " says oncologist William Haywar. Environmental factors

can never be totally eliminated; as Hayward points out, "We can’ t prepare a medicine against

cosmic rays. "

The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter. "First, we need to understand how the

normal cell controls itself. Second, we have to determine whether there are a limited number of

genes in cells which are always responsible for at least part of the trouble. If we can understand

how cancer works, we can counteract its action. "

66. The word "dormant" in the third paragraph most probably means__.

[A] dead

[B] ever-present

[C] inactive

[D] potential

[答案] C

[解题思路]

“dormant”一词出现在文章第三段的倒数第二句“Anything from cosmic rays to radiation to diet

may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains unknown”。通过上下文的“activate”（激

活）以及下一句中的“driven into action”，这些线索都可以说明“dormant”表示的是“inactive”

的意思，正确答案为C。“dormant”的意思是“休眠的”，原句的意思是“从宇宙射线、

辐射到日常饮食，任何东西都可能激活一个处于静止状态的致癌基因，但如何激活的原因却

尚不为人知”。

126

[题目译文]

第三段中的“dormant”这个词语的意思很可能是。

[A] 死的

[B] 经常存在的

[C] 不活跃的

[D] 潜在的

**1994**年**Passage 5**

Discoveries in science and technology are thought by "untaught minds" to come in blinding

flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have

it, look at the mold (霉) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He

experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his discovery.

Inventions and innovations almost always come out of laborious trial and error. Innovation is like

soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently

than they score.

The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal—and

so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between innovation and

others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on theirs, and

they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise. What ordinary people see as

fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid possibilities.

“Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there’s no particular virtue in doing

things the way they have always been done,” wrote Rudolph Flexh, a language authority, this

accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and suitcases

on wheels that make life more convenient : "How come nobody thought of that before?” The

creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as it appears. Innovators will not

accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average

person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route. The innovator

will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the long run and are bound to be more

interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends.

Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.

67. What does the author probably mean by “untaught mind” in the first paragraph?

[A] A person ignorant of the hard work involved in experimentation.

127

[B] A citizen of a society that restricts personal creativity.

[C] A person who has had no education.

[D] An individual who often comes up with new ideas by accident.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

文章第一句话指出“Discoveries in science and technology are thought by "untaught minds" to

come in blinding flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents”，接着下文以Sir Alexander

Fleming 的例子来反证第一句话的论点。可见作者认为科学技术中的新发现都是辛勤研究和

做实验的结果，而“untaught mind”对这些情况不了解，因此正确答案为A。C 选项是最这

个词语的表面意思理解，颇具迷惑性。B 和D 选项则与原文不符。第一句话的意思为“科

学技术上的发明创造被“不知内情者”看做灵感的眩目闪现或戏剧性事件的结果”。

[题目译文]

第一段中作者所说的“untaught mind”是什么意思？

[A] 一个不懂得实验过程中包含了辛勤工作的人

[B] 在一个限制个人创造力的社会中的人

[C] 一个没有接受过教育的人

[D] 一个时不时偶然地发现新想法的人

**1995**年**Passage l**

Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to assist

a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable price, thereby establishing a firm home market and so

making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it

helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an

increased need for labour, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the

costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as

much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube

would cost 20 per cent more.

And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the

products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven acts of Parliament govern

the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the

promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading

128

advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the

inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I

know that the article does what is claimed for it , and that it represents good value.

Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can

think of.

There is one more point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television

personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs. He

was drawing excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to persuade.

If its message were confined merely to information-and that in itself would be difficult if not

impossible to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly

persuasive----advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But perhaps

that is what the well-known television personality wants.

51. By the first sentence of the passage the author means that__.

[A] he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising

[(B) everybody knows well that advertising is money consuming

[C]) advertising costs money like everything else

[D] it is worthwhile to spend money on advertising

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题可以直接从分析该句的角度解题。原句是“Money spent on advertising is money spent as

well as any I know of”，as well as 的意思是“也，和……一样”，而“spent as well as any I know

of”用来形容该词组前面的money 这个词，此外any 后面为了避免重复省略了money 这个

词。因此整个句子的译文是“把钱花在做广告上是我所知道的最好的花钱方式”，可见C

选项符合原文意思。其余三个选项的意思都包含了原句之外的信息。

[题目译文]

作者通过本文第一句想表达的意思是。

[A] 他对于广告成本的状况相当了解

[B] 每个人都清楚地知道打广告要用很多钱

[C] 打广告就像任何其他事情一样需要花钱

[D] 在广告上花钱是值得的

129

**1995**年**Passage 2**

There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People have

generally viewed personal growth as an external result or product that can easily be identified and

measured. The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner

who learns a new language-all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show

for their efforts.

By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since by

definition it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is

not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as

they encounter new experiences and unexpected obstacles. In this process, the journey never really

ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to

accept.

In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to

confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may “fail” at first. How we see ourselves

as we try a new way of being is essential to our ability to grow. Do we perceive ourselves

as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar

experiences. Do we think we’re shy and indecisive? Then our sense of timidity can cause us to

hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step until we know the ground is safe. Do we think

we’re slow to adapt to change or that we’re not smart enough to cope with a new challenge? Then

we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all.

These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to

change and grow. If we do not confront and overcome these internal fears and doubts, if we

protect ourselves too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped inside a shell of our own

making.

57. When the author says "a new way of being" (line2-3, Para. 3) he is referring to__.

[A] a new approach to experiencing the world

[B] a new way of taking risks

[C] a new method of perceiving ourselves

[D] a new system of adaptation to change

[答案] A

[解题思路]

130

本题“a new way of being”所在句子为“How we see our-selves as we try a new way of being is

essential to our ability to grow”，其中可以判断being 在这里的意思是“生存”。B 选项对应

的是第三段第一句话的一个小方面，因此可以排除。第二句话后面的文字提了三个问题并作

了相应的回答，分三个方面对第二句话提供解释，C 和D 选项都只是对应其中的一个方面，

因而也可以排除。原句的意思是“我们在尝试新的生存方式的时候如何看待自己对于自己能

力增长是非常重要的”，A 选项与其最接近。

[题目译文]

当作者提到“a new way of being”（第三段第2-3 行），他指的是。

[A] 一种经历世界的新方式

[B] 一种审视自己的新方法

[C] 一种承担风险的新方式

[D] 一种适应变化的新系统

**1995**年**Passage 3**

In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become

complicated. Many of life’ s problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or

colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert

information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people

today.

In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War Ⅱ. As families

move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family

relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that

information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost

unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things

once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be

consciously learned.

Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now

has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one piece of

information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated , time-consuming and

sometimes even overwhelming .

Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which

enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has

ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in

131

machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information.

Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very

shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended

the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared

world wide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the

participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has

facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making

more information available to more people.

In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance.

Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems,

the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed.

"Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most

critical requirement of all people.

59. The word "it" (line 3, para. 2) most probably refers to__.

[A] the lack of stable communities

[B] the breakdown of informal information channels

[C] the increased mobility of families

[D] the growing number of people moving from place to place

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题中“it”这个词所在的句子为原文第二段的第二句话“As families move away from their

stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family relationships, the informal

flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that information will be available when

needed and will be trustworthy and reliable” 由于很多家庭搬出了原来那个稳定的社区，由此

离开了多年的朋友、并脱离了家族的联系，其非正式的信息交流就被中断了，因此他们也需

要时就可以获得可靠信息的信心也随之失去了），“with it”可见“it”指代的是之前所阐

述的内容，即“the informal flow of information is cut off”，即“非正式的信息交流”，可见

对应的正确答案为B 选项。其他三个选项的相关内容也都有出现在第二段，但均不是“it”

指代的内容。

[题目译文]

“it”这个词（第二段第三行）最有可能指的是。

132

[A] 缺少稳定的团体

[B] 非正式信息渠道的崩溃

[C] 家庭流动性的提高

[D] 更多的人们从一个地方搬到另一个地方

**1996**年**Passage l**

Tight-lipped elders used to say, "It’s not what you want in this world, but what you get.”

Psychology teaches that you do get what you want if you know what you want and want the right

things.

You can make a mental blueprint of a desire as you would make a blueprint of a house, and

each of us is continually making these blueprints in the general routine of everyday living. If we

intend to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, decide which food to

cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type of meal to be served.

Likewise, if you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and write a brief account of yourself.

In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself, for when you know exactly what you have to

offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.

This account of yourself is actually a sketch of your working life and should include education,

experience and references. Such an account is valuable. It can be referred to in filling out standard

application blanks and is extremely helpful in personal interviews. While talking to you, your

could-be employer is deciding whether your "wares" and abilities must be displayed in an orderly

and reasonably connected manner.

When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something

tangible to sell. Then you are ready to hunt for a job. Get all the possible information about your

could-be job. Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job and the firm. Keep your eyes and

ears open, and use your own judgment. Spend a certain amount of time each day seeking the

employment you wish for, and keep in mind: Securing a job is your job now.

51. What do the elders mean when they say, “It’s not what you want in this world, but what

you get.”?

[A] You’ll certainly get what you want.

[B] It’s no use dreaming.

[C] You should be dissatisfied with what you have.

[D] It’s essential to set a goal for yourself.

**1996**年**Passage 2**

With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers in Asia and America can

now watch the Corporation’s news coverage, as well as listen to it. And of course in Britain

listeners and viewers can tune in to two BBC television channels, five BBC national radio services

and dozens of local radio station. They are brought sport, comedy, drama, music, news and current

affairs, education, religion, parliamentary coverage, children’s pragrammes and films for an

annual license fee of 83 pounds per household.

It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years--yet the BBC’s future is now in doubt.

The Corporation will survive as a publicly-funded broadcasting organization, at least for the time

being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the subject of a nation-wide debate in

Britain.

The debate was launched by the Government, which invited anyone with an opinion of the

BBC-including ordinary listeners and viewers--to say what was good or bad about the Corporation,

and even whether they thought it was worth keeping. The reason for its inquiry is that the BBC’s

royal charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the organization as it is, or to

make changes.

134

Defenders of the Corporation-of whom there are many---are fond of quoting the American

slogan “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The BBC “ain’t broke”, they say, by which they mean it is

not broken (as distinct from the word ‘broke’, meaning having no money), so why bother to

change it?

Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world around it is changing. The

commercial TV channels---TV and Channel 4-were required by the Thatcher Government’s

Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each other for advertisers, and

cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival of new satellite channels--funded partly by advertising

and partly by viewers’ subscriptions-which will bring about the biggest changes in the long term.

57. The BBC`s "royal charter" (Line 4, Paragraph 3) stands for__

[A] the financial support from the royal family

[B] the privileges granted by the Queen

[C] a contract with the Queen

[D] a unique relationship with the royal family

[答案] C

[解题思路]

文章第三段的最后一句话指出“The reason for its inquiry is that the BBC’s royal charter runs

out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the organization as it is, or to make changes”（这

样征求民意的原因在于BBC 持有的皇家许可证到了1996 年就会到期，政府必须决定继续使

公司维持现状，抑或做出一些改变），royal charter 即皇家协议，也就是指BBC 与英国女王

签订的合约或协议，C 选项符合题意。A 和B 选项都与原文无关，而D 选项意思含糊，没

**1996**年**Passage 5**

Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in the publisher’s pipelines.

A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused and often

unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific theories for the origin and

evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and biology have provided a consistent ,

unified, and constantly improving account of what happened. "Scientific" creationism, which is

being pushed by some for “equal time” in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of

evolution are evil, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all scientists and the majority of

nonfunda mentalist religious leaders have come to regard “scientific” creationism as bad science

and bad religion.

The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At

appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. In the last

three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He describes their

programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the extent of their

deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is

religious, one might have expected more Christian behavior.

Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness of his

arguments. The nonspecialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and

argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the creationists will be extremely

clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen Jay Gould says: “This book stands for

reason itself.” And so it does-and all would be well were reason the only judge in the

creationism/evolution debate.

67. "Creationism" in the passage refers to__

[A] evolution in its true sense as to the origin of the universe

[B] a notion of the creation of religion

[C] the scientific explanation of the earth formation

[D] the deceptive theory about the origin of the universe

[答案] D

**1997**年**Passage 3**

Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or mental functioning is a drug.

Many people mistakenly believe the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine or an illegal

chemical taken by drug addicts. They don’t realize that familiar substances such as alcohol and

tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is now used by many

physicians and psychologists. The phrase “substance abuse” is often used instead of “drug abuse”

to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as harmfully misused as

heroin and cocaine.

We live a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances (drugs) is pervasive: an

aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a

cigarette for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently constructive uses of a

substance become misuses? First of all, most substances taken in excess will produce negative

effects such as poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a substance can also

lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence is marked first by an increased

tolerance, with more and more of the substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by

the appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued.

Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and

behavior are known as psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are commonly grouped

according to whether they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants initially speed

up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants slow it down. Hallucinogens have

137

their primary effect on perception, distorting and altering it in a variety of ways including

producing hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic (from the Greek word

meaning “mind-manifesting”) because they seemed to radically alter one’s state of consciousness.

60. The word “pervasive” (Line 1, Paragraph 2) might mean _____.

[A] widespread

[B] overwhelming

[C] piercing

[D] fashionable

[答案] A

[解题思路]

文章第二段第一句话指出“We live a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances

**1997**年**Passage 5**

Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as “steering the economy to a soft

landing” or “a touch on the brakes”, makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could be

further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain. And there are long,

variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the analogy that

138

likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear

view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.

Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of late.

Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its

lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way below the

double digit rates which many countries experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s.

It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists which

The Economist polls each month said that America’s inflation rate would average 3.5% in 1995.

In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and expected to average only about 3% for the year as a whole.

In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end

of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, inflation has been

consistently lower than expected in Britain and America.

Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and the

United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially America’s,

have little productive slack. America’s capacity utilization, for example, his historically high

levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen bellow most estimates of

the natural rate of unemployment — the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past.

Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a little

defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have up ended the

old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation.

69. The sentence “This is no flash in the pan” (Line 5, Paragraph 3) means that _____.

[A] the low inflation rate will last for some time

[B] the inflation rate will soon rise

[C] the inflation will disappear quickly

[D] there is no inflation at present

[答案] A

[解题思路]

题干中的这句话是英语中的一句谚语，大部分考生由于没有在英语环境中生活过，所以一般

不大可能了解这句话的含义，需要凭借上下文来进行推测。第三段最后一句话为“This is no

flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, inflation has been consistently lower than expected

in Britain and America”，其中分号后面的这部分意思为“在过去的几年里，英国和美国的

139

通胀率始终低于预期水平”，说明这个现象已经持续了几年了，而不是昙花一现，因而A

“This is no flash in the pan”（第三段第五行）这句话的意思是。

[A] 低通胀率将会持续一段时间

[B] 通胀率马上会上升

[C] 通货膨胀很快会消失

[D] 当前不存在通货膨胀

**1998**年**Passage 1**

Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is

humankind’s long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the ideal of forcing the

waters to do our bidding so fascination. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind.

Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good.

The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn’t help that building a big,

powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to assert

themselves. Egypt’s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam.

Turkey’s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.

But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example stopped the Nile

flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left - all in return for a giant reservoir of

disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.

And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized Europe,

Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam

on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of big dams. But

Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs a dam to prove itself.

Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go ahead to the even more wrong headed

Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will cause

hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the powerful, but

they are far from guaranteed.

Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of controlling water

can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are

possible without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it is hard to be

140

either proper, or scientific. It is time that the world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don’t need

a dam to be saved.

52. In paragraph 5, “the powerless” probably refers to _____ .

[A] areas short of electricity

[B] dams without power stations

[C] poor countries around India

[D] common people in the Narmada Dam area

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应信息为第五段的“And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will

cause hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction”（该大坝将给平民带来苦难，

**1998**年**Passage 3**

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of Gallileo’s

17th century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake’s harsh

remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism between science and the

humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.

Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore its critics

- but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have attacked “antiscience” in

several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R.Gross, a biologist at the University of

141

Verginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers University; and The Demon Haunted

World, by Car Sagan of Cornell University.

Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as “The Flight from

Science and Reason,” held in New York City in 1995, and “Science in the Age of

(Mis)information,” which assembled last June near Buffalo.

Antiscience clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find fault

primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned science’s

objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other

phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.

A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the antiscience tag has been attached to many

other groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks

of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.

Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, those manifesto, published in 1995,

scorns science and longs for return to a pretechnological utopia. But surely that does not mean

environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are antiscience, as an essay in

US News & World Report last May seemed to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science, argues

Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question

the evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other consequences

of industrial growth.

Indeed, some observers fear that the antiscience epithet is in danger of becoming meaningless.

“The term ‘antiscience’ can lump together too many, quite different things,” notes Harvard

University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science and Anti Science. “They have in

common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard themselves as more

enlightened.”

59. The word “schism” (Line 4, Paragraph 1) in the context probably means _____ .

[A] confrontation

[B] dissatisfaction

[C] separation

[D] contempt

[答案] C

[解题思路]

142

首先文章的第一段就谈到“Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of

culture”（科学与文化的其他方面的关系一直都很紧张）可见schism 指的就是这种uneasy

relationship。而B、D 选项都不是表示双方的关系，只是单方面的态度，因此可以排除。而

A 选项的程度与文章uneasy 也不符合。文章的后面几段展开了详细的关于两者之间如何分

化、分离的例子，因此只有C 选项是符合原文的。

[题目译文]

文中“schism”（第一段第三行）的意思可能是。

[A] 对峙

[B] 不满

[C] 分离

[D] 蔑视

**1998**年**Passage 4**

Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing more and more regional

competition, as population growth in the Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill.

This development - and its strong implications for US politics and economy in years ahead - has

enthroned the South as America’s most densely populated region for the first time in the history of

the nation’s head counting.

Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million people - numerically the third

largest growth ever recorded in a single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4 percent,

lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.

Americans have been migrating south and west in larger number since World War II, and the

pattern still prevails.

Three sun belt states - Florida, Texas and California - together had nearly 10 million more

people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th and

San Antonio from 15th to 10th - with Cleveland and Washington.DC, dropping out of the top 10.

Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow belt, census officials say,

Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too - and so did bigger crops of babies as yesterday’s

“baby boom” generation reached its child bearing years.

Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a related but

newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for places with

more jobs but with fewer people, too. Some instances-

● Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid growth rate - 37.1

143

percent since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population.

●Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1 percent

respectively. Except for Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is composed of Western

states with 7.5 million people - about 9 per square mile.

The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow belt to more bearable

climates.

Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious living than

in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, more than any

other state.

In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, mostly to other parts of

the West. Often they chose - and still are choosing - somewhat colder climates such as Oregon,

Idaho and Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization in the Golden

State.

As a result, California’s growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 18.5 percent - little more than

two thirds the 1960s’ growth figure and considerably below that of other Western states.

66. The word “demographers” (Line 1, Paragraph 7) most probably means _____ .

[A] people in favor of the trend of democracy

[B] advocates of migration between states

[C] scientists engaged in the study of population

[D] conservatives clinging to old patterns of life

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应的信息为“Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by

a related but newer phenomenon”( 此外，人口统计学家发现，向南部和西部的不断迁移还伴

**2001**年**Passage 5**

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might become a

part of a new international trend. A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my professional

progress prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of a

disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming "I wanted to spend more time with

my family".

Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and two novels later, my experiment in what the

Americans term "downshifting" has turned my tired excuse into an absolute reality. I have been

transformed from a passionate advocate of the philosophy of "having it all", preached by Linda

Kelsey for the past seven years in the page of She magazine, into a woman who is happy to settle

for a bit of everything.

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the

editorship of She after a build up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of "juggling your life",

and making the alternative move into "downshifting" brings with it far greater rewards than

financial success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to return to the kind of life Kelsey

used to advocate and I once enjoyed: 12 hour working days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain

of office politics and the limitations of being a parent on "quality time".

In America, the move away from juggling to a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle is a wellestablished

trend. Downshifting-also known in America as "voluntary simplicity"-has, ironically,

even bred a new area of what might be termed anti-consumerism. There are a number of bestselling

downshifting self-help books for people who want to simplify their lives; there are

newsletters, such as The Tightwad Gazette, that give hundreds of thousands of Americans useful

tips on anything from recycling their cling-film to making their own soap; there are even support

groups for those who want to achieve the mid-'90s equivalent of dropping out.

While in America the trend started as a reaction to the economy decline-after the mass

redundancies caused by downsizing in the late'80s-and is still linked to the politics of thrift, in

Britain, at least among the middle-class down-shifters of my acquaintance, we have different

reasons for seeking to simplify our lives.

145

For the women of my generation who were urged to keep juggling through the'80s,downshifting

in the mid-'90s is not so much a search for the mythical good life-growing your own organic

vegetables, and risking turning into one-as a personal recognition of your limitations.

69．"Juggling one's life" probably means living a life characterized by _________.

[A] non-materialistic lifestyle

[B] a bit of everything

[C] extreme stress

[D] anti-consumerism

**2002**年**Text 2**

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope with

work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has resulted in

robotics—the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And if scientists have

yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.

As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence

we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our factories

hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that

thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by

tireless robo-drivers. And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micromechanics,

there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery

with submillimeter accuracy—far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve

with their hands alone.

But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less

human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves—goals that pose a

real challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific error," says Dave Lavery,

manager of a robotics program at NASA, “we can’t yet give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to

reliably interact with a dynamic world."

Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite a spell

of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and

microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers

lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.

What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one

hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented—and human perception far more

complicated—than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error of a

machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the human

mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is

irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the

single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer systems on Earth can’t

approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it.

47. The word “gizmos" (line 1, paragraph 2) most probably means .

[A] programs

**2002**年**Text 4**

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications for

how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.

Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in

effect supported the medical principle of “double effect," a centuries-old moral principle holding

that an action having two effects—a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is

foreseen—is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to

control terminally ill patients’ pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the

patient.

Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield

doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients

sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death."

George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long

as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal

148

even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. “It’s like surgery," he says. “We don’t call those

deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their

death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their

suicide."

On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate

has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the

physical agony of dying.

Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy

of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End

of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced

medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying" as the twin problems

of end-of-life care.

The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospitals, to test knowledge of

aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care,

and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.

Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical initiatives

translate into better care. “Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their

patients are needlessly and predictably suffering," to the extent that it constitutes “systematic

patient abuse." He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear…that painful deaths are

presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should result in license suspension."

59. Which of the following best defines the word “aggressive" (line 3, paragraph 7)?

[A] Bold.

[B] Harmful.

[C] Careless.

[D]Desperate.

Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across CareerBuilder, a job

database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site’s personal

search agent. It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as location, title,

and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the database. Redmon chose

the keywords legal, intellectual property, and Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, he got his first

notification of an opening. “I struck gold,” says Redmon, who E-mailed his resume to the

employer and won a position as in-house counsel for a company.

With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding promising openings can be

time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the databases.

But although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. Narrowing your

criteria, for example, may work against you: “Every time you answer a question you eliminate a

possibility.” says one expert.

For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept——what you think you want to

do——then broaden it. “None of these programs do that,” says another expert. “There‘s no career

counseling implicit in all of this.” Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip

service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database ； when you get E-mail ， consider it a

reminder to check the database again. “I would not rely on agents for finding everything that is

added to a database that might interest me,” says the author of a job-searching guide.

Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite’s agent sends

out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only three

potential jobs——those it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in the database;

job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them——and they do. “On the day after we

send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our traffic,” says Seth Peets, vice president of

marketing for CareerSite.

Even those who aren‘t hunting for jobs may find search agents worthwhile. Some use them to

keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on compensation to

150

arm themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily employed, Redmon maintains his

agent at CareerBuilder. “You always keep your eyes open,” he says. Working with a personal

search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for you.

43. The phrase “making the biggest splash”(line 1,paragraph 3)most probably means

[A] causing the biggest trouble.

[B] exerting the greatest effort.

[C] achieving the greatest success.

[D] enjoying the widest popularity.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

“make a splash”是一个固定词组，但考生不了解这个词组的含义也无妨。首先，从原文中

我们可以发现这个词组是用来形容Straiford 公司的，从下文可以判断该公司在情报搜集行业

做得非常成功，是行业界的领先者。因此C 选项是正确答案。实际上“make a splash”的意

思是“引起轰动的，引人注目的”，即指一项活动非常成功、令人瞩目。

[题目译文]

“making the biggest splash”（第三段第一行）这个词语的意思可能是。

[A] 造成最大的麻烦

[B] 尽最大的努力

[C] 取得最大的成功

[D] 受到最广泛的欢迎

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems,

causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads

accounted for under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series of

mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the freight moved

by major rail carriers.

Supporters of the new super systems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial cost

reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by

fierce competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities

151

traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads

therefore have them by the throat.

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only

one rail company. Railroads typically charge such “captive” shippers 20 to 30 percent more than

they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they are being

overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government's Surface Transportation Board for

rate relief, but the process is expensive, time consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.

Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the long

run it reduces everyone's cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue,

shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so,

leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line. It's theory to which many

economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which

companies will flourish and which will fail. “Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who

wins and who loses in the marketplace?” asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who

frequently represents shipper.

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be his with a round of huge rate increases.

The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortuning fortunes. still does not earn

enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet

railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street cheering them on.

Consider the .2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail's

net railway operating income in 1996 was just million, less than half of the carrying costs of the

transaction. Who's going to pay for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will,

as Norfolk Southern and CSX increase their grip on the market.

54.The word “arbiters”(line 7,paragraph 4)most probably refers to those

[A] who work as coordinators.

[B] who function as judges.

[C] who supervise transactions.

[D] who determine the price.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息为第四段的最后一句话““Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who

wins and who loses in the marketplace?” asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who

frequently represents shipper”（“我们是否真的想让铁路公司成为在市场上决定谁败谁荣的

裁决者呢？”马丁·贝科维奇问道，他是一位常常代表铁路客户的华盛顿律师）。其中可以

看出arbiter 的功能在于决定who wins and who loses，自然就是一个类似于法官的裁判角色，

因此B 为正确答案。实际上arbiter 这个词的意思是“仲裁者”。A 选项的意思是“协调员”，

这种人不能起到决定输赢的作用，只进行协调，因而是错误选型。而C、D 选项“交易监督

员”和“价格决定者”更是与原句无关，可以排除。

[题目译文]

“arbiters”（第四段第七行）这个词的意思可能指那些。

[A] 做协调工作的人

[B] 起法官作用的人

[C] 监督交易的人

[D] 决定价格的人

Over the past century， all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned or

made illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet

unaware of such a disadvantage ,refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with

a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.

It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over Zodiac

cars when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that

Adam Abbott has in life over Zoeuml; Zysman. English names are fairly evenly spread between

the halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people have surnames beginning

with letters between A and K.

Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C

respectively; and 26 of George Bush‘s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first

half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking， six of the seven heads

of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush,

Chirac, Chrétien and Koizumi）. The world’s three top central bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg

and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese

characters. As are the world‘s five richest men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).

Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the

alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot sets in early. At the start of the first year in infant

school， teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their

names. So short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row ， and is rarely asked the

improving questions posed by those insensitive teachers. At the time the alphabetically

disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications,

because they get less individual attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.

The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their

awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ. Shortlists

for job interviews, election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all tend to be

drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they plough through them.

155

49. What does the author mean by “most people are literally having a ZZZ” (Lines 2-3，

Paragraph 5)?

[A] They are getting impatient.

[B] They are noisily dozing off.

[C] They are feeling humiliated.

[D] They are busy with word puzzles.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

文章第五段举了一个例子，“At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their

awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ”（大学

毕业典礼上，姓氏以A、B、C 打头的人自豪地受到了嘉奖，等轮到Zysman 的时候，大多

数人其实已经在打瞌睡了），说明由于报了太多名字，等轮到那些名字靠后的学生上台时，

台下的观众早已失去兴趣，不由地开始打盹。稍微熟悉一点英语知识的人都知道ZZZ 是表

示打盹的常见符号，文章巧妙地把这个符号与以Z 字母开头的学生上台联系起来，颇为生

动有趣。

[题目译文]

作者所谓的“most people are literally having a ZZZ”（第三段第二行）是什么意思？

[A] 他们变得不耐烦了

[B] 他们在呼呼大睡

[C] 他们感觉自己受到了侮辱

[D] 他们在做猜词游戏

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet. But the 47-

year-old manicurist isn’t cutting, filing or polishing as many nails as she’d like to. Most of her

clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped

showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. “I’m a good economic indicator,” she says. “I

provide a service that people can do without when they’re concerned about saving some dollars.”

So Spero is downscaling, shopping at a middle-brow Dillard’s department store near her suburban

Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. “I don’t know if other clients are going to abandon

me, too.” she says.

156

Even before Alan Greenspan’s admission that America’s red-hot economy is cooling, lots of

working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships to Gap

outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who

last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious

approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last

year’s pace. But don’t sound any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not

panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy’s long-term prospects, even as

they do some modest belt-tightening.

Consumers say they’re not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own fortunes

still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, “there’s a

new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by Wall Street

bonuses,” says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied

overbidding quiets. “Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three,” says John

Deadly, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their

ability to find and keep a job.

Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for lower

interest rates. Employers wouldn’t mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers

seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary

ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. Getting a table at Manhattan’s hot

new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co.

may still be worth toasting.

51. By “Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet” (Line 1, Paragraph 1), the author means

[A] Spero can hardly maintain her business.

[B] Spero is too much engaged in her work.

[C] Spero has grown out of her bad habit.

[D] Spero is not in a desperate situation.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章的第一段。从上下文看来，因为美国经济发展的放缓，Spero 的美甲

生意不如以前那么好做了，因为她的生意是那种人们想省钱的时候就可以不用做的。但是她

的生意还没到难以维持即将倒闭的程度，因此A 选型错误。B 选型的表述显然与原文无关。

C 选项有一定干扰性，题干中“biting her nails”可能会被误解作一个“bad habit”，实际上

157

一读原文会发现该选项纯属无中生有，因而也是错误的。经过排除，即使不知道引文的含义，

也可判断D 为正确选项。事实上题干中这句话的意思是“Spero 还没有到束手无策的时候”，

与D 选项的意思相符。

[题目译文]

作者说“Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet”（第一段第一句）的意思是。

[A] Spero 几乎维持不了她的生意了

[B] Spero 工作太忙了

[C] Spero 已经改掉她的坏习惯了

[D] Spero 还没有陷入绝望

53. When mentioning “the $4 million to $10 million range” (Paragraph 3) the author is talking

about

[A] gold market.

[B] real estate.

[C] stock exchange.

[D] venture investment.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本文较为容易定位和选择，因此从第三段从第二句话开始一直在举一个产业的例子，即房地

产业，标志性的词汇有home price, real-estate broker 等，而“the $4 million to $10 million range”

谈论的正是纽约曼哈顿的房价，因此选项中只有B“real estate”是房地产的意思，因而是正

确答案。

[题目译文]

作者提及的“the $4 million to $10 million range”（第三段第三行）意思是。

[A] 黄金市场

[B] 房地产

[C] 股票交易

[D] 风险投资

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a

colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even

be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human”, with the underlying assumption that

other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by

Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been

published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys, which have all the

necessary ingredients to capture the public imagination. They look cute. They are good-natured,

co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their finicky female

human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services”

than males (although why this is so remains a mystery).

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr Brosnan's and Dr de Waal's study.

The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally,

the monkeys were happy enough to swap pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when

two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the

other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.

In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So

when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand

hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her

token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the

chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the

other chamber (in the absence of an actual monkey able to eat it) was enough to induce sullen

behaviour in a female capuchin.

Dr Brosnan and Dr de Waal report that such behaviour is unusual in their trained monkeys.

During two years of bartering prior to these experiments, failure to exchange tokens for food

occurred in fewer than 5% of trials. And what made the behaviour even more extraordinary was

that these monkeys forfeited food that they could see—and which they would have readily

accepted in almost any other set of circumstances.

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In

the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable

only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems,

are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings

abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness

evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor

that the species had 35m years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

159

22. The statement “it is all too monkey” (Last line, Paragraph 1) implies that

[A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals.

[B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys’ nature.

[C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other.

[D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the

doubters insisted that we didn't know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science

uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government

should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades,

some 10 million smokers went to early graves.

There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the

growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences,

enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is definitely warming and that

the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect

ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Albert, added this key point in the

160

preface to the panel's report "Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with

the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important

policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of

present actions."

Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global

warming is incomplete, that it's OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure.

This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With

the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.

Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it's obvious that a majority of the

president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they

continue to press for more research -- a classic case of "paralysis by analysis."

To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and

oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won't take the legislative

initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic

Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry,

is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to

meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new

plants be environmentally sound.

28. What does the author mean by "paralysis by analysis"(Last line, Paragraph 4)?

[A] Endless studies kill action.

[B] Careful investigation reveals truth.

[C] Prudent planning hinders progress.

[D] Extensive research helps decision-making.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

“paralysis by analysis”这个词组的字面意思是“分析性瘫痪”，前面的破折号说明这个词

组是对破折号前面内容的解释。前面这句话提到，“Instead of a plan of action, they continue to

American no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the

English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest

book, Doing Our Own Thing. The Degradation of language and Music and why we should like,

care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views,

sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.

Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the

decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic specialty is language history and change, and he

sees the gradual disappearance of “whom”, for example, to be natural and no more regrettable

than the loss of the case-ending of Old English.

But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing”, has spelt the death of formal

speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone

when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then has

sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal,

performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written

English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.

Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that

Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle,

why we should, like care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language,

including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive-there exists no

language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas He is not arguing, as many do,

that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry in

their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem old-fashioned to

most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly

necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms-he is really grieving over the loss of

something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china”.

A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.

[A] modesty.

In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for

homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the

casualness and absence of consumption” launched by the 19th--century department stores that

offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a

knowledgeable elite.” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background.

This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports

are other forces for homogenization.

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating

but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports

that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented level nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998

163

immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent .In the 10 years prior to 1990,

3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000.

Now, consider three indices of assimilation –language, home ownership and intermarriage.

The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most

common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The

children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the

original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America

as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign–born immigrants who had arrived before 1970

had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born

Americans.

Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S –born

whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-

Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian–American women are married to non-Asians.

Rodriguez note that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrant living within

the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”

Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to

have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s

social induces suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.

21 .The word “homogenizing” (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means

[A] identifying

[B] associating

[C] assimilating

[D] monopolizing

[答案] C

[解题思路]

纵观全文，主要讨论的话题就是美国社会的机制使得美国人都变得同一化。即使不认识

homogenizing 这个词，第一段中为这个词语提供了许多解释，如第二句中的uniformity 就是

“同一化”的意思，此外还谈到了人们衣着、行为的同一化，百货商店又不再区别客户群等。

接下来的几个段落中还将了移民们如何被同化入美国社会，其中第五段的最后一句话还出现

了assimilative 这个词，即“具有同化性的”。因此答案为C，assimilating 意思是“同化的”，

动词是“assimilative”。

[题目译文]

“homogenizing”（第一段第二行）这个词的意思可能是。

[A] 识别

[B] 联系

[C] 同化

[D] 垄断

Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry-William Shakespeare-but there are

two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare

Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial

Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not

to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other

sights.

The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They

frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness.

It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself

an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise - making.

The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus- and often take in

Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side – don’t usually see the plays, and some of them

are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight -

seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the

town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into

the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.

The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy

of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in

town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there,

which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the

Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.

Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy.

(The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were

94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that

costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.

165

It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people

who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They

all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) –lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing

jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the

theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them

when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.

28. By saying “Stratford cries poor traditionally” (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the author implies that

[A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects

[B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties

[C] the town is not really short of money

[D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid

[答案] C

When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large

animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived, the large, slow-growing animals

were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be

happening in the oceans.

166

That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years what researchers such as Ransom

Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half

a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods de not attempt to estimate the

actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the

ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in

Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is

reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas,

it has halved again since then.

Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative, one reason for this is that fishing

technology has improved Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which

were not available 50 years ago that means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being

caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded

by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with

fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since to baited hooks would have

been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in

the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That

is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise.

Dr. Myers and Dr. worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future

management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among

marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline”. The notion is that people have failed to detect the

massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a

relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum

sustainable yield that can be cropped form a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is

about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to de

business.

33. By saying these figures are conservative (line in ,paragragf-3), Dr worm means that

[A] fishing technology has improved rapidly

[B] then catch-sizes are actually smaller then recorded

[C] the marine bio mass has suffered a greater loss

[D] the date collected so far are pit pf date.

[答案] C

present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes”（现在和过

是其含义。B 选项的表述与文章意思相反。D 选项认为这些数据已经过时，但数据保守并不

意味着它已过时，文章中也没有提到这一点，因此该选项错误。

[题目译文]

Worm 博士说“这些数字是保守的”（第三段第一行）这句话的意思是。

Many things make people think artists are weird and the weirdest may be this: artists only job is

to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited

for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as

insipid, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s

flowers of evil.

You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen

such misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of

innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the

world today.

After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting

happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass

media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted,

lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy,

the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls

168

were in peril and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly

need their art to be a bummer too.

Today the messages your average Westerner is bombarded with are not religious but

commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling,

smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And

since these messages have an agenda--to lure us to open our wallets to make the very idea of

happiness seem unreliable. "Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before

we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

What we forget--what our economy depends on is forgetting--is that happiness is more than

pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss

and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone to tell

us as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that

happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It’s a message even more bitter than a

clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

37. The word “bummer” (Line 5. paragraph 5) most probably means something

[A] religious

[B] unpleasant

[C] entertaining

[D] commercial

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题要求猜测bummer 这个词的意思，可以回到原文从上下文寻找线索。文章第五段第二句

话提到了“the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that

their souls were in peril and that they would someday be meat for worms”（最有效的大众媒体

是教堂，它提醒信徒们，他们的灵魂处于危险之中，他们总有一天会成为蛆虫的食物）。在

这一前提下，显而易见我们可以推出下一句话的意思应该是“因此，他们并不需要艺术再来

表现这种失落感”，因此答案为B。

[题目译文]

“bummer”（第五段第五行）这个词最可能的意思是。

[A] 宗教的

[B] 不愉快的

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup

tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to

have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the

European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find

this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.

What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain

astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen

capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive

children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.

Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he

believes strongly in "none of the above." Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear

engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he

switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a

person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. "With the first subject, after about 20

hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20," Ericsson recalls. "He kept improving, and

after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers."

This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically

determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise

than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their

abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person "encodes" the

information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson

determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than

simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback

and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of

pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and

biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers.

Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated.

170

Or, put another way, expert performers -- whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer

programming -- are nearly always made, not born.

22. The word "mania" (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means

[A] fun.

[B] craze.

[C] hysteria.

[D] excitement.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

“mania”这个词出现在文章第二段，原句为“soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive

children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania”（ 热爱足球的父母更可能在春季（每

年足球狂热的鼎盛时期）怀孕）。仔细观察原文可以发现mania 对应于句子开头的mad，因

此包含有“疯狂”的意思，正确答案为B 选项。A 和D 选项的两个词都没有达到“狂热”

这个程度，而C 选项的hysteria 在程度上又大大超过了mania，也不符合原文。

[题目译文]

“mania”（第二段第四行）最有可能的意思是

[A] 嬉笑

[B] 狂热

[C] 歇斯底里

[D] 兴奋

While still catching-up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way

ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing

depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda,

chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.

Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affects the

stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do

males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their

171

ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those

of the males.

Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities”

for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much

more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater

than men’s,” she observes, “It’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they

become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”

Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that

women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are

exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds

of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by,

unfortunately, parents or other family numbers, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wearand-

tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”

Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but wad determined to finish college.

“I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my

escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later her marriage ended and she became a

single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the

car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”

Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most

women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain.

Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it

threatens your health and your ability to function.

第五章、细节题命题思路透析

**Part I**、命题规律透析

细节题考查的是文章中的具体信息和关键细节，是每年考研题型中出现次数最多的

题型，一般都有十几道题。与主旨题考查考生对于文章的总体理解不同，细节题考查的是考

生对于文章局部结构的掌握。细节题相对于其他题型比较简单，同时做好这类题对于考生在

阅读理解部分取得基础分和高分都有着至关重要的作用，因此考生应该争取做对全部的细节

题。细节题考查的内容包罗万象，根据阅读文章的具体情况而定。对于议论文来说，细节题

的考查范围一般为以下内容：事实、数据、新旧观点、从正面或者反面来论证的例子、文章

结论等。对于说明文来说，细节题一般都会涉及到某个具体的事件、现象或者人物，问题往

往涉及到：时间、地点、人物、事件特征；起因、过程、结果、意义；目的、条件、步骤、

方法； 数据、年代、世纪等。

细节题的提问方式非常多样，一般都两种形式，即不完整的陈述句和完整的问句形

式。在陈述句中，常用的引出问题的词语或者词组包括from, because of, by, according to 等。

在问句中，常用的疑问词包括what, which, where, who, when, how （也就是我们平时经常说

的新闻写作的五个“W”+ 一个“H”）。下面我们还将有更加详细的规律剖析。

173

如果进行进一步的细分，则细节题还可以分为以下4 类：1、考查事实和同义转化

的细节题，这种题目一般会把原文中的信息在不改变原意的情况下通过另一种说法来表述，

因此选项中有可能会出现一些新的考生不熟悉的信息。2、考查因果关系的细节题，这种题

目中一般要求考生根据题干中的信息在原文中找到某一个现象存在或事件发生的原因和结

果，及其之间的关系。3、考查例证关系的细节题，这种题目一般考查考生对于作者在文章

中进行举例的目的的理解，也就是说，要考生找出文章中某一个具体的实例所论证的观点。

4、考查方式和手段的细节题，这种题目要求考生从文章找出做某一件事情的方法和手段。

16、文章的第一段和最后一段，以及每一个段落的第一句和最后一句话。

细节题正确答案选项的特点

1、原文中的某个或某些关键词语和词组在选项中由其同义词或者近义词代替，总体的语法

则没有变化。

2、通过语法的改变来重新叙述原文信息，比如在主动句和被动句之间进行变换，在一般陈

述句和it 引导的句子之间进行变换，在一般陈述句和强调句型之间进行变换等。

3、原文从某个角度叙述或论述某个现象或观点，而选项则从另一个角度进行叙述或者论述，

关于该现象或论点的本质没有任何变化。

4、原文和选项从相反的角度讨论同一个现象或者观点，如果原文正面表述则选项从反面切

入，而如果原文从反面论述那么选项就是正面的角度。

5、原文和选项之间是抽象和具体的关系，即如果原文是抽象的论述则选项是具体的实例，

相反，如果原文是具体的例子那么选项就在此基础上上升为抽象的概念或理论。

细节题干扰答案选项的特点

1、照抄原文，但是却故意改变其中的一两个起决定性作用的关键词语，从而改变句意，与

原文意思相左。

2、与常识相违背，或者在基本的逻辑上无法自圆其说。

3、与原文的意思相反。

4、把原文的信息进行张冠李戴，即把关于A 的细节放到B 上面，从而干扰考生阅读后的记

忆。

5、把原文的意思进行扩大或者缩小，即去原文部分的意思，或者扩大原文某个表述的外延。

6、使用一些表示绝对性意思的字眼，这些词语我们在总论中多次提及，一般都不会是正确

选项。

7、一些与原文无关的、或者在原文中根本没有出现过的信息。

细节题解题方法

在总论中我们曾经指出，考生在阅读文章的时候要在一些标记性词汇上坐上一些标

志，这些标志对于细节题尤其有用。考生根据阅读一次的印象和这些标志就能够迅速定位该

问题相对应的句子，从而找到答案。在做题时只要阅读与题目相关的句子即可，不用花太多

时间看上下文。需要注意的是，正确答案不一定与原文一模一样，而往往出现原文的同义释

义或者同义词和近义词。

179

此外，如果考查细节的因果关系，要抓住表示因果意义的单词来分析。在没有明显的表

示因果关系的情况下，就应该通过分析其逻辑关系来判断。

如果是考查细节的例证关系，则应该阅读文中举例出的前后句，因为在这些地方往往会

出现一个总结说明的句子，而这个句子就是正确答案，当然可能在表述上与选项有所不同。

另外，有一些例子看上去好像在论证某个枝节的问题，但实际上却和文章的中心思想紧密相

连，因此在做题时要记住紧扣文章主题，因为每一个例子都是为了文章的中心思想服务的。

最后，在遇到一些涉及细节的“三选一”题目中，要充分运用排除法帮助做题。

**Part II**、真题解题

**1993**年**Passage 1**

Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can

be starved and damaged? Judging from the drastic experiment of Frederick Ⅱ in the thirteenth

century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother

tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.

All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here.

What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life

especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.

Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are

still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the

signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If these sensitive

periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so

180

easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right time, but the process is slow and

hard once the critical stage has passed.

Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence and at a constant age, but

there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ.

At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months he can speak

simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three

to fifty words. At three he knows about l ,000 words which he can put into sentences, and at four

his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.

Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about

man’s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to

connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern "toy-bear". And even more

incredible is the young brain’s ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound

around him, to analyse, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.

But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child ,

where the mother recognizes the signals in the child’ s babbling ( 咿呀学语) , grasping and

smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction

because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the

child’s non-verbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language.

31. The purpose of Frederick II’s experiment was__

[A] to prove that children are born with the ability to speak

[B] to discover what language a child would speak without hearing any human speech

[C] to find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching a child to speak

[D] to prove that a child could be damaged without learning a language

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第一段最后一句话“Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he

heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent”（他希望能够发现孩子在没有听到任

何母语的时候会说什么，因此他嘱咐护士们都保持沉默），其中“Hoping to discover what

language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue”正是该实验的目的，因此正确答案

为B。A 和C 选项在原文中都没有提到。D 的内容与原文不符，原文中只是说，语言是否像

人类其他必需品一样，没有它孩子们在生命的某个关键时刻就会因此“饿死”或是被毁掉。

181

FrederickⅡ的实验与这一问题的答案或许有联系，但并不是这个实验的目的，因此D 也不正

确。

[题目译文]

弗雷德雷克二世的实验。

[A] 是用来证明孩子们天生就有说话能力

[B] 是用来发现孩子们在没有听到任何人类语言时会说何种语言

[C] 是用来找出细心的照料对于教孩子说话起到怎样的作用

[D] 是用来证明孩子们如果没有学会一门语言就会严重受害

32. The reason some children are backward in speaking is most probably that__

[A] they are incapable of learning language rapidly

[B] they are exposed to too much language at once

[C] their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak

[D] their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第三段的第一、二句话“Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by

Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking”（现在已经不存在弗雷德

雷克规定的那种严格的情境。但是，一些孩子在语言表达能力方面仍然会落后于其他孩子），

而只有C 选项符合原文的意思。A 表达的意思正好与第三段的第二句话的最后部分相反，B

和D 选项的内容在文章中没有提到。

[题目译文]

导致一些孩子语言能力落后于其他人的最可能原因是。

[A] 他们不能很快地学习语言

[B] 他们一下子面对着太多的语言

[C] 他们的母亲对于孩子们要说话的努力没有给与充分的反应

[D] 他们的母亲不够聪明，因此不能帮助孩子

182

33. What is exceptionally remarkable about a child is that

[A] he is born with the capacity to speak

[B] he has a brain more complex than an animal’s

[C]. he can produce his own sentences

[D] he owes his speech ability to good nursing

[答案] C

[解题思路]

根据题干内容，可以找出本题对应于文章倒数第二段的最后一句话“And even more incredible

is the young brain’s ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him,

to analyse, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways”（更加令人难以置信

的是，婴儿的大脑能够从他听到的周围各种声音中找到语言的顺序，并且对其进行分析，从

而把这种语言以新的方式进行组合和重新组合），因此C 选项符合这句话的意思，题干中

的remarkable 也正好对应于原文的incredible。A 选项表述是没有错误的，只是它不符合题

干的意思。关于B 选项，文章第五段的第二句提到了人类的大脑比动物复杂，但是这也不

是“exceptionally remarkable about a child”，因此该选项也可以排除。D 的内容与文章中表

达的内容有出入，原文第二段中说“without good mothering,in the first year of life especially,the

capacity to survive is seriously affected”（如果没有母亲的照料，初始的生命特别在第一年的

生存能力将受到巨大的影响），接着在第三段又指出，有些孩子在说话方面比较迟钝是因为

其母亲对他们所发出的信号反应不敏感，以致使他们的母亲忽视了这些敏感阶段，从而使孩

子获得语言技能的最佳时间飞逝而过，因此D 也不是正确答案

[题目译文]

对于孩子来说尤其重要的一点是

[A] 天生具有说话能力

[B] 拥有比动物更加复杂的大脑

[C] 能够说出一些句子

[D] 其语言能力取决于是否得到细心照料

**1993**年**Passage 2**

In general, our society is becoming one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic (官僚主

义的) management in which man becomes a small , well-oiled cog in the machinery. The oiling is

done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped music, and by psychologists and

183

"human-relations" experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become powerless,

that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and that he is bored with it. In fact, the

blue-and the white-collar workers have become economic puppets who dance to the tune of

automated machines and bureaucratic management.

The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might find themselves out of a job;

they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest in life.

They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental realities of human existence as

emotionally and intellectually independent and productive human beings.

Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their lives are no less empty than

those of their subordinates. They are even more insecure in some respects. They are in a highly

competitive race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary but even more a matter

of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are tested for intelligence as well as for the

tight mixture of submissiveness and independence. From that moment on they are tested again and

again-by the psychologists, for whom testing is a big business, and by their superiors, who judge

their behavior, sociability, capacity to get along, etc. This constant need to prove that one is as

good as or better than one’ s fellow-competitor creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes

of unhappiness and illness.

Am I suggesting that we should return to the preindustrial mode of production or to nineteenthcentury

"free enterprise" capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never solved by returning to a

stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming our social system from a

bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and consumption are ends in

themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full development of his potentialitiesthose

of love and of reason-are the aims of all social arrangements. Production and consumption

should serve only as means to this end, and should be prevented from ruling man.

36. By "a well-oiled cog in the machinery" the author intends to render the idea that man is

[A] a necessary part of the society though each individual’s function is negligible

[B] working in complete harmony with the rest of the society

[C] an unimportant part in comparison with the rest of the society, though functioning smoothly

[D]. a humble component of the society, especially when working smoothly

[答案] C

[解题思路]

184

本题可以采用排除法。题干的引文出现在文章的第一句话“In general, our society is becoming

one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic (官僚主义的) management in which man

becomes a small , well-oiled cog in the machinery”，__________此外，该段第二句话的后半句进一步指

出“yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become powerless, that he does not

wholeheartedly participate in his work and that he is b**or**ed with it”（然而，这种润滑并未改变

这样一个事实：人已变得无能为力，不再全心全意投入到工作，并对工作感到厌烦）。首先，

A 选项的“individual’s function is negligible”在原文没有提到，B 的“complete harmony”

与第三句话的基调不符合。D 选项“humble”这个词在文章中没有体现出来，因此也可以排

除。而C 选项与原句“总的来说，我们的社会正在变成一个由官僚主义管理方式来统治的

大企业。在这一企业中，人成了机器中润滑良好的小齿轮”的意思较为吻合。

[题目译文]

作者用“a well-oiled cog in the machinery”要表达的意思是人

[A] 是社会不可或缺的一部分，尽管个人的作用几乎是可以忽略的

[B] 与社会的其他部分和谐地一起运作

[C] 与社会其他部分相比是不重要的，尽管运作良好

[D] 社会的一个卑贱部分，特别是运作良好的时候

37. The real cause of the anxiety of the workers and employees is that

[A] they are likely to lose their jobs

[B] they have no genuine satisfaction or interest in life

[C] they are faced with the fundamental realities of human existence

[D] they are deprtved of their individuality and independence

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章的第二段“The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might

find themselves out of a job; they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real

satisfaction or interest in life. They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental

realities of human existence as emotionally and intellectually independent and productive human

beings”（工人与雇员心情焦虑不仅仅是因为他们可能失业，而且因为他们不能在生活中获

得真正的满足和兴趣。在他们一生中，没有作为情感上与智力上独立的、具有创造性的人去

面对人类生存中的根本现实），其中A 选项是第一句话中提到的表面原因，不是真正的原

185

因。B 选项虽然与原文的说法吻合，但是没有具体指出真正的原因，也可以排除。C 选项C

与文章意思有出入，这些人总是要面对人类生存的根本现实，但是只是面对的方式有所不同。

而D 选项对应于最后一句的“as emotionally and intellectually independent and productive

human beings”，是正确答案。

[题目译文]

工人和雇员焦虑的真正原因是

[A] 他们可能会丢掉工作

[B] 他们生活中没有真正的满足和兴趣

[C] 他们面对着人类生存的根本现实

[D] 他们被剥夺了个性和独立性

**1993**年**Passage 3**

When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him: he

can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.

A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by which the

inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention to the

public after that period terminates. Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a

patent extended to alter this normal process of events.

The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV

receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent’ s normal life there was

no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention.

Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the library

attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that are free for anyone to

use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent experts often advise

anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a search through live patents that the one sure

way of avoiding violation of any other inventor’ s right is to plagiarize a dead patent. Likewise ,

because publication of an idea in any other form permanently invalidates further patents on that

idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern technological

advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.

Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most "new" ideas are, in fact,

as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or

dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. The basic

patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original ideas behind

186

television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine

car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the rear.

42. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

[A] When a patent becomes out of effect, it can be re-patented or extended if necessary.

[B]. It is necessary for an inventor to apply for a patent before he makes his invention public.

[C] A patent holder must publicize the details of his invention when its legal period is over.

[D] One can get all the details of a patented invention from a library attached to the patent office.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题可以采用排除法。A 选项对应于文章第二段的最后一句话“Only in the most exceptional

circumstances is the lifespan of a patent extended to alter this normal process of events”（），因

此只有在极为特殊的情况下才可能延长专利期，因此A 选项错误。B 选项的表述在文章中

没有提及。D 选项对应于第四段的第一句话“Because a patent remains permanently public after

it has terminated, the shelves of the library attached to the patent office contain details of literally

millions of ideas that are free for anyone to use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even

re-patent”（因为一项专利到期后，该专利就永久公开了，因此，专利局的图书馆书架上那

数百万个观点只要是超过半个世纪，任何人都可自由使用，有时甚至可以重新取得专利） ，

但是原文没有提到是否可以得到关于任何发明的所有细节，因此该选项也可以排除。而C

选项对应于文章第二段第一句话“A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an

inventor and the state, by which the inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and

publishes full details of his invention to the public after that period terminates”（专利的授予是

发明者和国家之间形成的一种契约。根据这种契约，发明者对自己的发明可获得一定时期的

垄断权，垄断期结束后，就要把该项发明的全部细节公布于众），选项表述符合原句，是正

确答案。

[题目译文]

下面的哪一项符合文章的意思？

[A] 当一项专利过期之后，在必要时可以重新授予其专利权或延长专利期

[B] 发明者在公布他的发明之前申请专利是非常必要的

[C] 专利拥有者再合法时期之后必须公布其发明的细节

[D] 人们可以从专利局的图书馆中得到关于一项专利发明的所有细节

187

43. George Valensi’s patent lasted until 1971 because

[A] nobody would offer any reward for his patent prior to that time

[B] his patent could not be put to use for an unusually long time

[C] there were not enough TV stations to provide colour programmes

[D] the colour TV receiver was not available until that time

[答案] B

[解题思路]

乔治·瓦伦西的例子出现在文章第三段“The longest extension ever granted was to Georges

Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most

of the patent’ s normal life there was no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the

invention”（延长时间最长的专利批准给了乔治·瓦伦西。他于1939 年获准的彩电接收机

线路的专利一直延续到1971 年，因为在当时这项专利期内没有彩色电视节目可以接收，因

此专利无望被采用），显然只有B 选项符合原句的意思。

[题目译文]

乔治·瓦伦西的专利一直持续到1971 年，因为

[A] 在那个时间以前没有人能够给他颁发任何奖项

[B] 他的专利在一段相当长的时期内不能用于实际用途

[C] 没有很多电视台能够提供彩色节目

[D] 那个时候还没有彩色电视机

**1994**年**Passage 1**

The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, marketoriented

economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their

money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen,

striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen;

and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods

and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual

consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of

individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how

resources are used to produce it.

188

An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer

demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this

mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to

relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short

supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated

from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost,

this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price

and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the

American economic system.

The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own

productive resources (private property) , and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over

natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy,

the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also

certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract

with another private individual.

52. The first two &sentences in the second paragraph tell us that__.

[A] producers can satisfy the consumers by mechanized production

[B] consumers can express their demands through producers

[C] producers decide the prices of products

[D] supply and demand regulate prices

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应于第二段的开头两句话“An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the

mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the

American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise

and fall in response to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers”

（市场型经济中的一个重要因素是反映消费者需求以及生产者对消费者需求作出反应的机

制。在美国经济中，这一机制是由价格体制体现的，价格随消费者的相对需求与生产者的供

应情况而上下浮动。如果供不应求，价格就上升，有些消费者就会被排挤出市场），即价格

机制的形成取决于供求关系，可见D 选项符合原文表述。A 选项中的“mechanized production”

（机械化制造）是对该段第一句话中“mechanism”（机制）的误解，可以排除。B 和C 选

项的表述都显然不符合原文的内容。

189

[题目译文]

第二段的前两句话告诉我们。

[A] 生产者能够通过机械化的生产满足消费者

[B] 消费者可以通过生产者来表达他们的需求

[C] 生产者决定产品的价格

[D] 供给和需求状况规定了价格

**1994**年**Passage 2**

One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They

give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country,

and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these

credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in

scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the "cashless

society" is not on the horizon—it’s already here.

While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers

too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide

range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows

businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold and how

fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the

same time these computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the most

efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also

identify preferred customers for promotional campaigns. Computers are relied on by

manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which

products to emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep

track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.

Numerous other commercial enterprise, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and

electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to consumers through

the use of computers.

55. According to the passage, the credit card enables its owner to__.

[A] withdraw as much money from the bank as he wishes

[B] obtain more convenient services than other people do

190

[C] enjoy greater trust from the storekeeper

[D] cash money wherever he wishes to

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第一段的第二句话，即“They give their owners automatic credit in stores,

restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country, and even abroad, and they make many

banking services available as well”（ 信用卡持有者可在商店、饭店、宾馆，以及在当地、

外地甚至国外赊购货物，同时信用卡还可以使他们得到银行提供的许多服务）。B 选项符合

该句的内容，是正确选项。A 选项很明显是错误的，C 选项则在原文中没有提及。D 选项的

表述过于绝对，该段第三句话中的“scattered locations”（分散的地点）决不意味着“wherever he

wishes to”，从常理判断这也是不可能的，因此该选项也是错误答案。

[题目译文]

根据本文，信用卡能使其主人。

[A] 从银行中得到他想要的无论多少数目的钱

[B] 比其他人得到了更多的便利服务

[C] 享受商店老板更多的信任

[D] 可以在任何地方取现

**1994**年**Passage 3**

Exceptional children are different in some significant way from others of the same age. For

these children to develop to their full adult potential, their education must be adapted to those

differences.

Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find ourselves describing their

environment as well. While the leading actor on the stage captures our attention, we are aware of

the importance of the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both the family and the

society in which exceptional children live are often the key to their growth and development. And

it is in the public schools that we find the full expression of society’ s understanding—the

knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the next generation.

Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that minor we can see the strengths, the

weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and the central values of the culture itself. The great

interest in exceptional children shown in public education over the past three decades indicates the

191

strong feeling in our society that all citizens, whatever their special conditions, deserve the

opportunity to fully develop their capabilities.

"All men are created equal.”We’ve heard it many times, but it still has important meaning for

education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used by this country’s founders to

denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to mean equality of opportunity. That

concept implies educational opportunity for all children-the right of each child to receive help in

learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that capacity be small or great. Recent court

decisions have confirmed the right of all children-disabled or not-to an appropriate education, and

have ordered that public schools take the necessary steps to provide that education. In response,

schools are modifying their programs, adapting instruction to children who are exceptional, to

those who cannot profit substantially from regular programs.

59. In Paragraph 2, the author cites the example of the leading actor on the stage to show that

[A] the growth of exceptional children has much to do with their family and the society

[B] exceptional children are more influenced by their families than normal children are

[C] exceptional children are the key interest of the family and society

[D] the needs of the society weigh much heavier than the needs of the exceptional children

[答案] A

[解题思路]

题干中提到的例子出现在文章第二段的第二句“While the leading actor on the stage captures

our attention, we are aware of the importance of the supporting players and the scenery of the play

itself”（当舞台上的主角吸引了我们的注意力后，我们也能意识到配角及剧目本身场景的重

要性），而第三句话则对这一比较作了进一步的说明，即“Both the family and the society in

which exceptional children live are often the key to their growth and development”（特殊儿童所

处的家庭及社会环境常常是他们成长和发展的关键），A 选项符合原文的意思。B 选项与文

章内容不符合，C 选项“key interest”显然是错误信息，而D 选项也与题干的问题无关。

[题目译文]

在第二段中，作者引用了舞台上主要演员的例子说明。

[A] 特殊儿童的成长与他们的家庭及所处的社会有紧密关系

[B] 特殊儿童比一般儿童受到家庭的影响更大

[C] 特殊儿童是其家庭和社会的关键兴趣所在

[D] 社会的需求比特殊儿童的需求更加重要

192

60. The reason that the exceptional children receive so much concern in education is that__.

[A] they are expected to be leaders of the society

[B] they might become a burden of the society

[C] they should fully develop their potentials

[D] disabled children deserve special consideration

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章第三段的最后句话“The great interest in exceptional children shown in

public education over the past three decades indicates the strong feeling in our society that all

citizens, whatever their special conditions, deserve the opportunity to fully develop their

capabilities”（ 过去30 年间公共教育所表现出的对特殊儿童的巨大关注表明了存在于我们

社会中的那种强烈的感受，即所有公民，不论情况特殊与否，都应该得到全面发展其能力的

机会），C 选项与该表述是相符的。A 和B 选项意思相反而且显然是错误的，而D 选项与

原句中关于平等机会的呼吁相矛盾。

[题目译文]

特殊儿童之所以得到如此多的关注是应为。

[A] 人们期望他们成为社会的领导者

[B] 他们可能会成为社会的负担

[C] 他们应该充分发展他们的潜能

[D] 残疾儿童应该得到特殊的照顾

**1994**年**Passage 4**

“I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we’ll know in vast detail how cancer

cells arise,” says microbiologist Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. “But,” he cautions, “some

people have the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure will rapidly follow. Consider

Pasteur. He discovered the causes of many kinds of infections, but it was fifty or sixty years

before cures were available.”

This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from cancer will survive at least five

years. In the year 2000, the National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 75 percent. For

193

some skin cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90 percent. But other survival statistics

are still discouraging-----13 percent for lung cancer, and 2 percent for cancer of the pancreas (胰

腺).

With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how cancer works is not easy. The

researchers made great progress in the early 1970s, when they discovered that oncogenes, which

are cancer-causing genes ( 基因), are inactive in normal cells. Anything from cosmic rays to

radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains unknown. If several

oncogenes are driven into action, the cell, unable to turn them off, becomes cancerous.

The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the likelihood that many cancers are

initiated at the level of genes suggests that we will never prevent all cancers. "Changes are a

normal part of the evolutionary process," says oncologist William Haywar. Environmental factors

can never be totally eliminated; as Hayward points out, "We can’t prepare a medicine against

cosmic rays."

The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter. "First, we need to understand how the

normal cell controls itself. Second, we have to determine whether there are a limited number of

genes in cells which are always responsible for at least part of the trouble. If we can understand

how cancer works, we can counteract its action. "

63. The example of Pasteur in the passage is used to__.

[A] predict that the secret of cancer will be disclosed in a decade

[B] indicate that the prospects for curing cancer are bright

[C] prove that cancer will be cured in fifty to sixty years

[D] warn that there is still a long way to go before cancer can be conquered

[答案] D

[解题思路]

巴斯德的例子出现在文章第一段的最后一句话“He discovered the causes of many kinds of

infections, but it was fifty or sixty years before cures were available”（他发现了许多传染病的

成因，但治疗方法却在五六十年后才问世），这句话主要服务于第一段前面两句话的观点

“I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we’ll know in vast detail how cancer cells

arise,” says microbiologist Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. “But,” he cautions, “some

people have the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure will rapidly follow”（我有极

大的信心相信到这个十年期结束时我们将会详尽地知晓癌细胞的生成原因，”微生物学家罗

伯特·温伯格，一位癌症专家如此说道，“但是，”他又告诫说，“有些人认为一旦人们弄

194

清了病因，治疗方法很快就会跟上）。也就是说，发现癌症的原因并不意味着癌症很快就可

以被治愈，因此正确答案为D 选项。其他三个选项皆与第一段的主要观点无关。

[题目译文]

第一段中巴斯德的例子是用来。

[A] 预测癌症的秘密在10 年内将被解开

[B] 暗示治疗癌症的前景是光明的

[C] 证明癌症将在50-60 年后可以被治愚

[D] 警告要征服癌症还有很长一段路要走

64. The author implies that by the year 2000,__.

A. there will be a drastic rise in the five-year survival rate of skin-cancer patients

B. 90 percent of the skin-cancer patients today will still be living

C. the survival statistics will be fairly even among patients with various cancers

D. there won` t be a drastic increase of survival rate of all cancer patients

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题可以与第二段进行一一对应并排除错误选项。A 选项对应于该段第二句“In the year

2000, the National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 75 percent”（据国家癌症研究

所，到2000 年存活率将升至75％），但文章中没有提到任何“drastic rise”，因此该选项

错误。而B 选项的表述也与这句话有出入，因为文章指的是今后五年的存活率为90%，而

不是现在的情况。C 选项的表述与该段最后两句话“But other survival statistics are still

discouraging-----13 percent for lung cancer, and 2 percent for cancer of the pancreas”（但其他类

型癌症的存活数据却仍令人沮丧——肺癌13％，胰腺癌2％）的意思相反。D 选项则很好

地总结概括了全文的内容，是正确答案。

[题目译文]

作者暗示到了2000 年。

[A] 皮肤癌患者在五年内生存下来的几率会有很大的变化

[B] 现在90%的皮肤癌患者可以活到那个时候

[C] 各种癌症患者生存下来的几率都差不多

[D] 癌症患者活下来的几率不会有大的变化

195

65. Oncogenes are cancer-causing genes__.

[A] that are always in operation in a healthy person

[B]. which remain unharmful so long as they are not activated

[C] that can be driven out of normal cells

[D] which normal cells can` t turn off

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应于原文第三段的第二、三句话“The researchers made great progress in the early 1970s,

when they discovered that oncogenes, which are cancer-causing genes (基因), are inactive in

normal cells. Anything from cosmic rays to radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but

how remains unknown”（研究人员在70 年代早期取得了很大进展，他们发现导致癌症的癌

基因在正常细胞里是不活跃的。从宇宙射线、辐射到日常饮食，任何东西都可能激活一个处

于静止状态的致癌基因，但如何激活的原因却尚不为人知），即认为这种细胞只要没有被激

活都是无害的，因此正确答案为B 选项。A 和D 选项都是这种细胞被激活以后才会出现的

情况，而C 选项与原文无关，属无中生有。

[题目译文]

癌基因是有特征且可以引发癌症的基因。

[A] 总是在一个健康人的身体中运行

[B] 只要没有激活就是无害的

[C] 可以被从正常的细胞中赶出来

[D] 正常的细胞无法避开的

**1994**年**Passage 5**

Discoveries in science and technology are thought by "untaught minds" to come in blinding

flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have

it, look at the mold (霉) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He

experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his discovery.

Inventions and innovations almost always come out of laborious trial and error. Innovation is like

196

soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently

than they score.

The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal—and

so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between innovation and

others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on theirs, and

they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise. What ordinary people see as

fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid possibilities.

“Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there’s no particular virtue in doing

things the way they have always been done,” wrote Rudolph Flexh, a language authority, this

accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and suitcases

on wheels that make life more convenient : "How come nobody thought of that before?” The

creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as it appears. Innovators will not

accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average

person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route. The innovator

will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the long run and are bound to be more

interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends.

Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.

68. According to the author, what distinguishes innovators from non-innovators?

[A] The variety of ideas they have.

[B] The intelligence they possess.

[C] The way they deal with problems.

[D] The way they present their findings.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题可以定位于文章第二段的第二句话“The prime difference between innovation and others is

one of approach”（创新者与普通人的主要区别在于处理问题的方法不同），approach 即对

应于C 选项的way （方式、方法），因此C 为正确选项。其余三个选项均与原文不符，没

有对应信息。

[题目译文]

根据文章作者，创新者和非创新者的区别在什么地方？

[A] 他们想法的类别

197

[B] 他们的智力水平

[C] 他们处理问题的方式

[D] 他们报告新发现的方式

69. The author quotes Rudolph Flesch in Paragraph 3 because__.

[A] Rudolph Flesch is the best-known expert in the study of human creativity

[B] the quotation strengthens the assertion that creative individuals look for new ways of doing

things.

[C] the reader is familiar with Rudolph Flesch’ s point of view

[D] the quotation adds a new idea to the information previously presented

[答案] B

[解题思路]

文章第三段Rudolph Flesch 的话为“Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that

there’s no particular virtue in doing things the way they have always been done”（创造性思维也

许只不过意味着能够意识到按老办法办事没什么特别可取之处），也就是说，要有所创新可

以采用新的方法，因此只有B 选项符合这个意思。A 选项显然不符合事实，原文只是提到

他是一个“a language authority”，并不是什么“best-known expert in the study of human

creativity”。C 和D 的说法都没有在原文中找到佐证，也可以排除。

[题目译文]

作者在文章第三段中引用鲁道夫·弗莱契的话是因为。

[A] 鲁道夫·弗莱契是在人类创造力领域最著名的专家

[B] 引言支持了创新者寻找新的方式来做事情这个说法

[C] 读者们对鲁道夫·弗莱契的观点很熟悉

[D] 引言给前面的信息增添了新的想法

**1995**年**Passage l**

Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to assist

a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable price, thereby establishing a firm home market and so

making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it

helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an

198

increased need for labour, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the

costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as

much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube

would cost 20 per cent more.

And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the

products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven acts of Parliament govern

the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the

promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading

advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the

inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I

know that the article does what is claimed for it , and that it represents good value.

Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can

think of.

There is one more point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television

personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs. He

was drawing excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to persuade.

If its message were confined merely to information-and that in itself would be difficult if not

impossible to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly

persuasive----advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But perhaps

that is what the well-known television personality wants.

52. In the passage, which of the following is NOT included in the advantages of advertising?

[A]Securing greater fame

[B] Providing more jobs

[C] Enhancing living standards

[D]Reducing newspaper cost

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题要求判断选项中哪项不是广告的优点，其对应信息在文章的第一段。该段第三句“By

drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living”（通过各种新观

念对人们注意力的吸引，广告有助于极大地提高人们的生活水平）对应于C 选项。第四句

“By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labour, and is therefore an

effective way to fight unemploymen”（广告还能够促进需求的增加，从而确保对劳动力的需

199

求，因此是抵制失业的有效方法）对应于B 选项。而最后一句“It lowers the costs of many

services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of

your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent

more”（广告也降低了很多服务业的成本，如果没有广告的话，我们每天看的报纸其价格会

上涨到现在的四倍，电视收视费也会翻番，坐车或地铁的花费将多出20%以上）对应于Ｄ

选项。只有Ａ选项的内容在原文中没有提及，因此答案为A。

[题目译文]

在本文中，下列那一项不是广告的优势？

[A] 保证取得更大的名声

[B] 改进生活水平

[C] 提供更多的工作

[D] 降低报纸的成本

53. The author deems that the well-known TV personality is_.

[A]very precise in passing his judgment on advertising

[B]interested in nothing but the buyers` attention

[C] correct in telling the difference between persuasion and information

[D]obviously partial in his views on advertising

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题中提到的“the well-known TV personality”出现在文章第四段，其言论为该段第二句

“Recently I heard a well-known television personality declare that he was against advertising

because it persuades rather than informs”（近来我听说一个著名的电视人物声称自己反对广

告，因此广告是在说服人们、而不是为人们提供信息），而作者的评论则出现在下一句。同

时在第五段中作者进一步指出了这位名人的错误，如果广告只纯粹提供信息而不具有任何说

服性的话，那么“”。可见作者认为这位电视名人的说法是偏激的，因此应得答案为D。A

与C 选项的表述都与作者态度相反，而B 选项与最后两段无关。

[题目译文]

作者认为这个著名的电视名人。

[A] 对于广告的评价非常精确

200

[B] 除了购买者的注意力外对其他都不感兴趣

[C] 对于说服力和信息之间的区别的描述非常正确

[D] 对于广告的观点显然是有偏颇的

**1995**年**Passage 2**

There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People have

generally viewed personal growth as an external result or product that can easily be identified and

measured. The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner

who learns a new language-all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show

for their efforts.

By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since by

definition it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is

not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as

they encounter new experiences and unexpected obstacles. In this process, the journey never really

ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to

accept.

In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to

confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may “fail” at first. How we see ourselves

as we try a new way of being is essential to our ability to grow. Do we perceive ourselves

as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar

experiences. Do we think we’re shy and indecisive? Then our sense of timidity can cause us to

hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step until we know the ground is safe. Do we think

we’re slow to adapt to change or that we’ re not smart enough to cope with a new challenge? Then

we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all.

These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to

change and grow. If we do not confront and overcome these internal fears and doubts, if we

protect ourselves too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped inside a shell of our own

making.

55. A person is generally believed to achieve personal growth when__.

[A] he has given up his smoking habit

[B] he has made great efforts in his work

[C] he is keen on learning anything new

201

[D] he has tried to determine where he is on his journey

[答案] A

[解题思路]

题干中的问题在文章第一段有详细讨论，因此可迅速定位信息。该段第二句指出“People have

generally viewed personal growth as an external result or product that can easily be identified and

measured”（人们通常把个人的成长视为非常容易识别和衡量的外在结果），因此正确的选

项应该是一件完成的事情，而非在过程中。显然四个选项中只有A 选项是确定性的结果，

其他三项都还处于过程中。

[题目译文]

当一个人的时候，人们认为他取得了个人进步。

[A] 放弃吸烟习惯

[B] 工作上付出了巨大的努力

[C] 对于新事物充满了热情

[D] 在旅途中试图找出自己在哪里

56. In the author` s eyes, one who views personal growth as a process would__.

[A] succeed in climbing up the social ladder

[B]j udge his ability to grow from his own achievements

[C] face difficulties and take up challenges

[D] aim high and reach his goal each time

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题主要对应于文章第三段的第一句话“In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to

have a willingness to take risks, to confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they

may “fail” at first”（为了成长、为了走上新的旅途，人们需要有承担风险、面对未知世界、

接受初次失败可能性的意愿），因此四个选项中只有C 符合题意。而其余三个选项的内容

在原文中都没有相应的表述。

[题目译文]

202

在作者看来，那些把个人成长看成是一个过程的人将会。

[A] 成功地爬上社会阶梯

[B] 从其个人成就中判断自己成长的能力

[C] 面对困难并且接受挑战

[D] 目标高远并且每次都能达到目标

58. For personal growth, the author advocates all of the following except_.

[A] curiosity about more chances

[B] promptness in self-adaptation

[C] open-mindedness to new experiences

[D] avoidance of internal fears and doubts

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章最后一段。该段第一句话指出“These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are

both unavoidable and necessary if we are to change and grow”（如果我们希望改变、成长，那

么这些不安全和自我怀疑的感觉是不可避免和必不可少的），D 选项与原文意思相反，是正

确选项。而A、B、C 选项在第三段的三个问句和回答中都有所体现。

[题目译文]

关于个人成长，作者认为下面各项除了都是应该提倡的。

[A] 对于更多机会的好奇心

[B] 对于新的经历的开放态度

[C] 迅速适应新环境的能力

[D] 对于内心恐惧和怀疑的避免

**1995**年**Passage 3**

In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become

complicated. Many of life’ s problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or

colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert

information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people

today.

203

In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War Ⅱ. As families

move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family

relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that

information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost

unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things

once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be

consciously learned.

Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now

has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one piece of

information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated , time-consuming and

sometimes even overwhelming .

Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which

enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has

ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in

machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information.

Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very

shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended

the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared

world wide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the

participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has

facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making

more information available to more people.

In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance.

Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems,

the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed.

"Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most

critical requirement of all people.

60. The main problem people may encounter today arises form the fact that__.

[A] they have to learn new things consciously

[B] they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy information

[C] they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily

[D] they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended family.

[答案] C

204

[解题思路]

文章第一段的最后一句话指出“Where to turn for expert information and how to determine

which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people today”（当今人们面临的问题是

去哪里去寻求专家建议、以及如何决定接受哪些专家的建议），可见人们现在面临的困难是

如何方便快捷地得到自己需要的信息，而下文也都是就这个问题展开论述的，因此C 为正

确答案。其余三个选项显然都是本文旨在讨论的主要问题。

[题目译文]

现在人们可能遇到的主要问题可能来自以下事实。

[A] 他们不得不有意识地去学新的东西

[B] 他们缺少保护可靠信息的信心

[C] 他们在快速取得需要信息方面有困难

[D] 他们在大家族中很难进行随意的交流

**1995**年**Passage 4**

Personality is to a large extent inherent--A-type parents usually bring about A-type offspring.

But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if competition is important to the

parents, it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.

One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a

highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the ‘win at all costs’ moral standard and

measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children compete

against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer system , in which competitive

A-types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have

dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the first marathon runner, dropped dead

seconds after saying: “Rejoice, we conquer!”

By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate emphasis on

examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The

merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in the certain

knowledge of failure is positively harmful.

Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A-youngsters change into B’s. The world

needs A types, and schools have an important duty to try to fit a child’s personality to his possible

future employment. It is top management.

205

If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, more time might be spent

teaching children surer values. Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially medicine,

could be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as sensitivity

and sympathy. It is surely a mistake to choose our doctors exclusively from A-type stock. B’s are

important and should be encouraged.

63. According to the passage, A-type individuals are usually__.

[A] impatient

[B] considerate

[C] aggressive

[D] agreeable

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本文第一段第二句话指出“But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if

competition is important to the parents, it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their

children”（但是环境也有着深远的影响，因为如果竞争对于父母来说很重要的话，那么竞

争也有可能成为孩子生活中的一个重要因素），同时第二段第一句进一步指出“One place

where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a highly

competitive institution”（孩子变成A 型性格的一个地方就是学校，而学校从本质上来说是

一个竞争的机构），可见A-type 的人都喜欢竞争、争强好胜，显然只有C 选项符合这个意

思。

[题目译文]

根据本文，A 类型的人们通常是。

[A] 不耐烦的

[B] 考虑周到的

[C] 有闯劲的

[D] 使人愉快的

64. The author is strongly opposed to the practice of examinations at schools because__.

[A] the pressure is too great on the students

[B] some students are bound to fail

206

[C] failure rates are too high

[D] the results of exanimations are doubtful

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应信息在文章第三段，该段中作者提出了反对学校考试教育制度的观点，该段最后一

句话谈到“The merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition

in the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful”（通过考试来竞争这种方式的优点是

令人怀疑的，但是明知失败却还要竞争则无疑是有害的），因此对应的正确答案为B。A 和

C 选项都与原文无关。D 选项的“doubtful”一词虽然对应于第三段最后一句话的

“questionable”，但原文指的是考试制度的优点令人怀疑，与选项表述有出入，因此该选项

也可以排除。

[题目译文]

作者强烈反对学校里面的考试制度，因为。

[A] 这给了学生们太大的压力

[B] 一些学生注定要不及格

[C] 不及格率太高了

[D] 考试结果令人怀疑

65. The selection of medical professionals are currently based on__.

[A]candidates’ sensitivity

[B]academic achievements

[C] competitive spirit

[D]surer values

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应于原文最后一段，该段第一句指出“If the preoccupation of schools with academic

work was lessened, more time might be spent teaching children surer values”（如果学校减少对

于学业的强调，那么或许就会有更多的时间来叫学生们更加有价值的东西），第二句进一步

以医学人才为例指出“Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially medicine, could be

207

made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as sensitivity and

sympathy”（或许对于护理职业人员的选择来说，特别是对于医学界的人员选择来说，应该

减少对于化学成绩的侧重，而更多考察从业人员的敏感性和同情心，这样更好一些）。第二

句所谈到的情况时假设情况，说明实际情况与该句相反，即现在挑选医学人才仍然以学业成

绩为第一位，因此正确答案为B 选项。

[题目译文]

现在医学专业人员的遴选主要基于。

[A] 候选人的敏感性

[B] 竞争精神

[C] 学术成就

[D] 更加令人信服的品质

**1995**年**Passage 5**

That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an obvious but nevertheless

remarkable activity called remembering. Learning could not occur without the function popularly

named memory. Constant practice has such as effect on memory as to lead to skillful performance

on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and understanding these words. Socalled

intelligent behaviour demands memory, remembering being a primary requirement for

reasoning. The ability to solve any problem or even to recognize that a problem exists depends on

memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street is based on remembering many earlier

experiences.

Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task or for any learned material.

Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and the adaptive

consequences may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting can seem to be

adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be intffpreted to have survived through a process

of natural selection in animals. Indeed, when one’s memory of an emotionally painful experience

lead to serious anxiety, forgetting may produce relief. Nevertheless, an evolutionary interpretation

might make it difficult to understand how the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived

natural selection.

In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its possible aspects, it is helpful to

consider what would happen if memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids orientation in time,

since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing clues for inferring duration.

Without forgetting, adaptive ability would suffer, for example, learned behaviour that might have

208

been correct a decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of people who (by ordinary

standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were full of confusion. This forgetting

seems to serve that survival of the individual and the species.

Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited capacity that provides

adaptive flexibility specifically through forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are made

between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). Indeed, there is evidence that

the rate at which individuals forget is directly related to how much they have learned. Such data

offers gross support of contemporary models of memory that assume an input-output balance.

67. From the evolutionary point of view,__.

[A]forgetting for lack of practice tends to be obviously inadaptive .

[B]if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be very adaptive

[C] the gradual process of forgetting is an indication of an individual` s adaptability

[D]sudden forgetting may bring about adaptive consequences

[答案] D

[解题思路]

由于本题的四个选项都围绕着forgetting 进行讨论，因此对应信息在原文第二段。A 选项对

应于该段第二句话“Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and

the adaptive consequences may not seem obvious”（如果在一段时间里面没有时间，那么所学

到的东西往往就会遗忘；其适应性结果可能就不太明显），A 选项的表述与原文相反，是错

误答案。B 选项“if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be very adaptive”（如

果一个人突然变得非常健忘，他一定非常能适应新环境）与原文“sudden forgetting”（突然

的遗忘）意思不同，可以排除。第二段第三句话指出“Yet, dramatic instances of sudden

forgetting can seem to be adaptive.”（但是，那些突然忘记的戏剧性时刻也可以被视为是具有

适应性），第四句话进一步指出“In this sense, the ability to forget can be intffpreted to have

survived through a process of natural selection in animals”（ 从这种意义上讲，遗忘的能力可

以被解释为是在动物界通过自然选择幸存下来的结果），可见遗忘的能力不是个体适应性的

证明，而是整体进化过程的一部分，因此C 选项也是错误答案。D 选项对应于该段第三句

话，是正确答案。

[题目译文]

从进化论观点来看。

[A] 缺乏实践造成的遗忘显然是没有适应能力的表现

209

[B] 如果一个人突然变得非常健忘，他一定非常能适应新环境

[C] 逐渐遗忘的过程是一个人适应环境能力的反映

[D] 突然的遗忘可能会带来适应新环境的结果

68. According to the passage, if a person never forgot,__.

[A] he would survive best

[B] he would have a lot of trouble

[C] his ability to learn would be enhanced

[D] the evolution of memory would stop

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应信息为文章第三段倒数第二句话“Cases are recorded of people who (by ordinary

standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were full of confusion”（ 有记录显示，

很少遗忘的人们的日常生活中充满了各种混乱），显而易见正确答案为B 选项。

[题目译文]

根据本文，如果一个人从来不忘记任何事情，那么。

[A] 他的生存能力最强

[B] 他就有很多麻烦

[C] 他的学习能力会得到加强

[D] 记忆的进化会停止

**1996**年**Passage l**

Tight-lipped elders used to say, "It’s not what you want in this world, but what you get.”

Psychology teaches that you do get what you want if you know what you want and want the

right things.

You can make a mental blueprint of a desire as you would make a blueprint of a house, and

each of us is continually making these blueprints in the general routine of everyday living. If we

intend to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, decide which food to

cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type of meal to be served.

210

Likewise, if you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and write a brief account of yourself.

In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself, for when you know exactly what you have to

offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.

This account of yourself is actually a sketch of your working life and should include education,

experience and references. Such an account is valuable. It can be referred to in filling out standard

application blanks and is extremely helpful in personal interviews. While talking to you, your

could-be employer is deciding whether your "wares" and abilities must be displayed in an orderly

and reasonably connected manner.

When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something

tangible to sell. Then you are ready to hunt for a job. Get all the possible information about your

could-be job. Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job and the firm. Keep your eyes and

ears open, and use your own judgment. Spend a certain amount of time each day seeking the

employment you wish for, and keep in mind: Securing a job is your job now.

52. A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner is used in this passage as__.

[A] an illustration of how to write an application for a job

[B] an indication of how to secure a good job

[C] a guideline for job description

[D] a principle for job evaluation

[答案] A

[解题思路]

“A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner”的例子出现在文章第三段的第二句话“If

we intend to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, decide which food to

cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type of meal to be served”（ 如果我们想要

邀请朋友共进晚餐，那么我们就要计划一份菜单、列出一份购物清单、决定先做哪道菜，无

论做什么样的菜，这样的计划是至关重要的），它作为例子是对下面第三段内容如何写简历

和求职信做准备的，因此A 选项符合题意。B 和D 选项内容都在原文中没有提及，而C 选

项的表述不是该例子要说明的问题。

[题目译文]

文章中使用请朋友吃晚饭之前做计划这个例子是想。

[A] 说明如何写求职申请

[B] 说明如何找到一份好的工作

211

[C] 为工作说明提供指导方针

[D] 为工作评估提供准则

53. According to the passage, one must write an account of himself before starting to find a job

because __.

[A] that is the first step to please the employer

[B] that is the requirement of the employer

[C] it enables him to know when to sell his services

[D] it forces him to become clearly aware of himself

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章第四段的最后一句“In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself,

for when you know exactly what you have to offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your

services”（在为工作计划蓝图的时候，你要从自己开始，因为只有当你明确你自己能够提

供什么的时候，你才能够非常聪明地规划去什么地方推销你的服务），四个选项中D 选项

的表述与原文的意思最为贴切。A 和B 选项都提到了employer 的作用，但人们在找工作前

写简历的主要目的不是为了取悦雇主，A 选项错误。而B 选项表述过于绝对且与原文无关，

并不是每个雇主都要求看简历。C 选项有一定干扰性，但在文章第四段提到的是“where to sell

his services”，而不是“when to sell his services”。

[题目译文]

根据文章，找工作之前必须要先写一份工作简历，因为。

[A] 这是取悦雇主的第一步

[B] 这是雇主的要求

[C] 这样可以让你知道什么时候去推销自己的服务

[D] 这样可以使他清楚地了解自己

54. When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something__.

[A]definite to offer

212

[B]imaginary to provide

[C] practical to supply

[D]desirable to present

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章最后一段的第一句话“When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your

abilities and desires, you have something tangible to sell”（ 当你为自己的能力和愿望精心准

备了一幅蓝图之后，你就有实实在在的东西可以推销了），A 选项中的definite 对应于原句

的关键词汇“tangible”，因此是正确答案。而其余三个选项都没有表达出原文这个词的意

思。

[题目译文]

当你为自己的能力和愿望精心地准备了一幅蓝图的时候，你就已经有了。

[A] 明确的东西可以提供

[B] 想象的东西可以提供

[C] 实用的东西可以提供

[D] 令人想要得东西可以提供

**1996**年**Passage 2**

With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers in Asia and America can

now watch the Corporation’s news coverage, as well as listen to it. And of course in Britain

listeners and viewers can tune in to two BBC television channels, five BBC national radio services

and dozens of local radio station. They are brought sport, comedy, drama, music, news and current

affairs, education, religion, parliamentary coverage, children’s pragrammes and films for an

annual license fee of 83 pounds per household.

It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years--yet the BBC’s future is now in doubt.

The Corporation will survive as a publicly-funded broadcasting organization, at least for the time

being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the subject of a nation-wide debate in

Britain.

The debate was launched by the Government, which invited anyone with an opinion of the

BBC-including ordinary listeners and viewers--to say what was good or bad about the Corporation,

and even whether they thought it was worth keeping. The reason for its inquiry is that the BBC’s

213

royal charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the organization as it is, or to

make changes.

Defenders of the Corporation-of whom there are many---are fond of quoting the American

slogan “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The BBC “ain’t broke”, they say, by which they mean it is

not broken (as distinct from the word ‘broke’, meaning having no money), so why bother to

change it?

Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world around it is changing. The

commercial TV channels---TV and Channel 4-were required by the Thatcher Government’s

Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each other for advertisers, and

cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival of new satellite channels--funded partly by advertising

and partly by viewers’ subscriptions-which will bring about the biggest changes in the long term.

55. The world famous BBC now faces__.

[A] the problem of new coverage

[B] an uncertain prospect

[C] inquiries by the general public

[D] shrinkage of audience

[答案] B

[解题思路]

文章第二段第一句话为“It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years--yet the BBC’s

future is now in doubt”（当然，英国的听众和观众们收看到两个BBC 电视频道、收听到五

个BBC 国内广播电台和几十个地方广播电台），纵观四个选项，只有B 选项符合原文，

uncertain 对应原文的in doubt，prospect 对应于future。A 和D 选项显然不是BBC 现在面临

的问题。而C 选项的错误在于公众的质询和提议是在政府的组织下进行的，这并不是BBC

当前面临的问题。

[题目译文]

举世闻名的BBC 现在面临着。

[A] 新闻报道的问题

[B] 一个不确定的未来

[C] 公众的质询

[D] 听众和观众数量的减少

214

56. In the passage, which of the following about the BBC is not mentioned as the key issue?

[A] Extension of its TV service to Far East.

[B] Programmes as the subject of a nation-wide debate.

[C] Potentials for further interactional co-operations.

[D] Its existence as a broadcasting organization.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题可与原文对应进行排除。A 选项对应于文章的第一句话“With the start of BBC World

Service Television, millions of viewers in Asia and America can now watch the Corporation’s

news coverage, as well as listen to it”（随着BBC 国际电视服务节目的开播，数百万来自亚洲

和美洲的观众们现在不仅可以收听到该公司的新闻报道，而且还可以收看到），选项中的Far

East（远东）属于Asia 的范围，因此A 选项表述正确。B 选项对应文章第二段最后一句话

“The Corporation will survive as a publicly-funded broadcasting organization, at least for the time

being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the subject of a nation-wide debate in

Britain”（该公司至少在目前将作为依靠政府基金维持的广播公司生存下来，但是其作用、

规模和它的节目却在当前成为了全英国争论的话题），可以看出B 选项也是符合原文意思

的。D 选项对应于文章第三段的最后一句话“The reason for its inquiry is that the BBC’s royal

charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the organization as it is, or to make

changes”（这样征求民意的原因在于BBC 持有的皇家许可证到了1996 年就会到期，政府

必须决定继续使公司维持现状，抑或做出一些改变），因此“Its existence as a broadcasting

organization”也是文章的key issue。而C 选项中关于国际合作的潜力在原文并没有提及，

因此C 选项是符合题意的正确答案。

[题目译文]

在文章中，下面关于BBC 的表述中哪一个不是关键问题？

[A] 其电视服务向远东的延伸。

[B] 其节目成为全国争论的话题。

[C] 进一步进行国际合作的可能。

[D] 作为广播公司的生存。

215

58. The foremost reason why the BBC has to readjust itself is no other than__

[A] the emergence of commercial TV channels

[B] the enforcement of Broadcasting Act by the government

[C] the urgent necessity to reduce costs and jobs

[D] the challenge of new satellite channels

[答案] D

[解题思路]

文章问的是BBC 必须进行调整的原因，而文章的最后一句话指出了最重要的原因“But it is

the arrival of new satellite channels--funded partly by advertising and partly by viewers’

subscriptions-which will bring about the biggest changes in the long term”（但是在将来会引起

最大变化的还是新卫星频道的出现——这些卫星频道的资金部分来自广告收入，部分来自观

众交纳的收视费），之所以这是最重要的原因，是因为该句中提到satellite channels 会带来the

biggest changes，因此D 选项符合文章意思。其余三个选项都是次要原因，不是foremost。

此外，题干中“no other than”是“不外乎，正是”的意思，如果没有正确理解该词组也会

影响作题。

[题目译文]

BBC 不得不做出调整的最主要原因是。

[A] 商业电视频道的出现

[B] 政府《广播法》的实施

[C] 降低成本和裁员的迫切需求

[D] 新的卫星频道带来的挑战

**1996**年**Passage 3**

In the last half of the nineteenth century “capital” and “labour” were enlarging and perfecting

their rival organizations on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by a limited liability

company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. The change met the technical requirements of

the new age by engaging a large professional element and prevented the decline in efficiency that

so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms in the second and third generation after the

energetic founders. It was moreover a step away from individual initiative, towards collectivism

and municipal and state-owned business. The railway companies, though still private business

managed for the benefit of shareholders, were very unlike old family business. At the same time

216

the great municipalities went into business to supply lighting, trams and other services to the

taxpayers .

The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business had important

consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased the

numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing

irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and almost equally

detached from the responsible management of business. All through the nineteenth century,

America, Africa, India, Australia and parts of Europe were being developed by British capital, and

British shareholders were thus enriched by the world’s movement towards industrialisation.

Towns like Bournemouth and Eastboume sprang up to house large. “comfortable” classes who had

retired on their incomes, and who had no relation to the rest of the community except that of

drawing dividends and occasionally attending a shareholders’ meeting to dictate their orders to the

management. On the other hand "shareholding" meant leisure and freedom which was used by

many of the later Victorians for the highest purpose of a great civilisation.

The “shareholders” as such had no knowledge of the lives, thoughts or needs of the workmen

employed by the company in which he held shares, and his influence on the relations of capital

and labour was not good. The paid manager acting for the company was in more direct relation

with the men and their demands, but even he had seldom that familiar personal knowledge of the

workmen which the employer had often had under the more patriarchal system of the old family

business now passing away. Indeed the mere size of operations and the numbers of workmen

involved rendered such personal relations impossible. Fortunately, however, the increasing power

and organization of the trade unions, at least in all skilled trades, enabled the workmen to meet on

equal terms the managers of the companies who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike

and lockout taught the two parties to respect each other’ s strength and understand the value of fair

negotiation.

59. It’s true of the old family firms that__.

[A] they were spoiled by the younger generations

[B] they failed for lack of individual initiative

[C] they lacked efficiency compared with modem companies

[D] they could supply adequate services to the taxpayers

[答案] C

[解题思路]

217

本题的对应信息在文章第一段，关于“old family firms”的表述出现在该段的第三句“The

change met the technical requirements of the new age by engaging a large professional element

and prevented the decline in efficiency that so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms in

the second and third generation after the energetic founders”（通过聘用大批专业人员来，这种

变革满足了新时代的技术要求，并防止了效率的降低。在过去，这种效率的下滑使得许多第

一代千辛万苦创立的旧式家族企业毁在第二、三代手中），其中decline in efficiency 是这类

公司衰败的主要原因，也就是现代企业更有效率，对应于C 选项。A 选项的错误在于文中

的意思是公司在第二、三代的时候由于公司效率低而衰落，而不是只年轻一代刻意去毁掉公

司。B 与该句表述不符合。D 选项则不是老式家族公司的特点。

[题目译文]

下面那种说法对于古老的家族企业来说是正确的？

[A] 它们在后代的手中毁掉了

[B] 由于缺乏个人创业精神而垮掉了

[C] 比起现代企业来它们缺乏效率

[D] 它们能为纳税人提供足够的服务

60. The growth of limited liability companies resulted in__.

[A] the separation of capital from management

[B] the ownership of capital by managers

[C] the emergence of capital and labour as two classes

[D] the participation of shareholders in municipal business

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第二段，该段第一句话指出“The growth of the limited liability company and

municipal business had important consequences”（有限责任公司及市政企业的发展具有重要

的意义），而下一句话“Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly

increased the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life

representing irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and

almost equally detached from the responsible management of business”（ 这种大规模的对资本

与企业的非个人操纵大大地增加了股东作为一个阶层的数量及其重要性。他们是国民生活的

重要部分，代表着非责任性的财富，不仅与土地及土地所有者的责任相分离，而且几乎也同

218

样与企业的责任经营脱离）就是consequences，其中“ ”即A 选项中的“the separation of capital

from management”的意思，deatach 有“分离”的意思，因此A 选项为正确答案。其余三个

选项都没有在该段中有等同意思的对应信息。

[题目译文]

有限责任公司的发展导致了。

[A] 资本与管理的分离

[B] 管理人员对资本的拥有

[C] 资方和劳方成为两个阶层

[D] 股东在市营企业中的参与

61. According to the passage, all of the following are true except that__.

[A] the shareholders were unaware of the needs of the workers

[B] the old firm owners hand a better understanding of their workers

[C] the limited liability companies were too large to run smoothly

[D] the trade unions seemed to play a positive role

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题主要对应于文章最后一段，可以采用排除法。A 选项对应于该段第一句话“The

“shareholders” as such had no knowledge of the lives, thoughts or needs of the workmen

employed by the company in which he held shares, and his influence on the relations of capital

and labour was not good”（这种股东尽管持有股份，却丝毫不了解他们所持股公司里工人们

的生活、思想和需求。他们对劳资关系也不会产生任何积极的影响），unaware 即no

knowledge，因此A 的表述符合原文。B 选项对应于该段第二句“The paid manager acting for t he

company was in more direct relation with the men and their demands, but even he had seldom that

familiar personal knowledge of the workmen which the employer had often had under the more

patriarchal system of the old family business now passing away”（花钱请来的代表公司经营的

经理与员工以及他们的需求有着更直接的关系，但即使是经理也很少像正在被淘汰的旧式家

族企业家长制中的雇主那样对员工有着亲近的、个人化的了解），可见B 的表述也符合原

文。D 选项对应于该段最后两句“Fortunately, however, the increasing power and organization of

the trade unions, at least in all skilled trades, enabled the workmen to meet on equal terms the

managers of the companies who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike and lockout

219

taught the two parties to respect each other’ s strength and understand the value of fair

negotiation”（ 然而，幸运的是，工会的势力和组织在日益壮大，至少在各个技术行业是这

样，从而工人与雇用他们的公司经理们拥有了平等的地位。罢工和封厂的严酷惩罚使双方学

会了彼此尊重的力量，理解公正协商的价值），可见工会还是起到了积极的作用。而C 选

项的表述在原文中没有涉及，是正确答案。

[题目译文]

根据文章判断下面哪种说法是错误的？

[A] 股东不了解工人的需求

[B] 以前的公司老板对工人更加了解

[C] 有限责任公司大得无法平稳发展

[D] 工会似乎起到了积极的作用

**1996**年**Passage 4**

What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early America-breakthroughs such

as the telegraph , the steamboat and the weaving machine?

Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country’s excellent elementary schools;

a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums to inventors;

and above all the American genius for nonverbal , “spatial” thinking about things technological .

Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools our early mechanics

,especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, were generally literate and at home in

arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.

Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and inventiveness to this educational

advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 1853 reported, “With a mind

prepared by thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly into the skilled

workman.”

A further stimulus to invention came from the “premium” system, which preceded our patent

system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, originated abroad, offered inventors

medals, cash prizes and other incentives.

In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were awarded at country fairs and

at the industrial fairs in major cities. Americans flocked to these fairs to admire the new machines

and thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance.

Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the American worker took readily

to that special kind of nonverbal thinking required in mechanical technology. As Eugene Ferguson

220

has pointed out , “A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be reduced to unambiguous

verbal descriptions; they are dealt with in his mind by a visual, nonverbal process . . . The designer

and the inventor . . . are able to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices that as yet do not

exist.”

This nonverbal “spatial” thinking can be just as creative as painting and writing. Robert Fulton

once wrote, “The mechanic should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels, etc., like a

poet among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, in which

a new arrangement transmits a new idea.”

When all these shaping forces--schools, open attitudes, the premium system, a genius for spatial

thinking--interacted with one another on the rich U. S. mainland, they produced that American

characteristic, emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But in earlier times it meant a

friendly but competitive striving for fame and excellence.

63. According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions in early America was in a

large part due to__

[A]elementary schools

[B] enthusiastic workers

[C] the attractive premium system

[D]a special way of thinking

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第二段，该段列举了“the great outburst of major inventions in early America”

的各项因素，其中该段最后一部分指出了“above all the American genius for nonverbal ,

“spatial” thinking about things technological”（最重要的是美国人在处理技术性事物时天生具

备的非语言的“空间”思维才能），这种““spatial” thinking”正是选项D 的“a special way of

thinking”，因此D 为正确选项。

[题目译文]

根据文章的作者，早期美国涌现大批重大发明的主要原因在于。

[A] 基础教育

[B] 热情的工人

[C] 吸引人的奖励制度

[D] 特殊的思维方式

221

65. A technologist can be compared to an artist because __

[A] they are both winners of awards

[B] they are both experts in spatial thinking

[C] they both abandon verbal description

[D] they both use various instruments

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章倒数第二段关于技术人员和艺术家的比较“This nonverbal “spatial” thinking

can be just as creative as painting and writing. Robert Fulton once wrote, “The mechanic should

sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels, etc., like a poet among the letters of the alphabet,

considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, in which a new arrangement transmits a new

idea.””（这种非语言的”“空间”思维方式与绘画和写作一样具有创造性。罗伯特·法欧曾

写道：“技术人员坐在杠杆、螺钉、楔子、轮子等东西中间，就如同一位诗人处在字母表的

字母之中，应该把它们看做是自己思想的一种表达，其中每一个新的组合都能传达一种新的

想法。”），从该段第一句话就可以判断B 为正确选项。C 选项的错误在于他们擅长nonverbal

“spacial” thnking 并不意味着他们放弃了语言描述，而A 和D 选项的表述在原文没有提及。

[题目译文]

技术专家可以同艺术家相提并论是因为。

[A] 他们都是获奖者

[B] 他们都擅长空间思维

[C] 他们都放弃用语言来描述

[D] 他们都使用不同的工具

**1995**年**Passage 5**

Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in the publisher’s pipelines.

A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused and often

unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific theories for the origin and

evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and biology have provided a consistent ,

unified, and constantly improving account of what happened. "Scientific" creationism, which is

222

being pushed by some for “equal time” in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of

evolution are evil, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all scientists and the majority of

nonfunda mentalist religious leaders have come to regard “scientific” creationism as bad science

and bad religion.

The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At

appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. In the last

three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He describes their

programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the extent of their

deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is

religious, one might have expected more Christian behavior.

Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness of his

arguments. The nonspecialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and

argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the creationists will be extremely

clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen Jay Gould says: “This book stands for

reason itself.” And so it does-and all would be well were reason the only judge in the

creationism/evolution debate.

68. Kitcher`s book is intended to __.

[A] recommend the views of the evolutionists

[B] expose the true features of creationists

[C] curse bitterly at this opponents

[D] launch a surprise attack on creationists

[答案] B

[解题思路]

文章第二段讲述了Kitcher 这本书的主要内容，其中从第一、三、四句话中可以看出其主要

写作目的“The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution...

In the last three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He

describes their programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the

extent of their deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise”（ 金切尔这本著作

的前四章简单地介绍了进化论……在该书的最后三章中，他毫不留情地对创世纪论者进行了

猛烈抨击。他揭露了这些人的纲领和手段，对那些不了解创世纪论者惯用手法的人来说，其

欺骗和歪曲事实的程度会让他们感到既气愤又惊讶），即向读者揭示创世纪论的真正面目。

223

A 显然与Kitcher 的基调相反。C 选项语气过重，Kitcher 实际上并没有对对手作人身攻击，

D 选项在原文中没有涉及。

金切尔的书旨在。

[A] 推荐进化论者的观点

[B] 揭露创世纪论者的真面目

[C] 诅咒他的对手

[D] 对创世纪论者发动突然袭击

**1997**年**Passage 1**

It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing and

final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia’s Northern Territory became the first legal

authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die.

The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the

Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to

Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group’s on line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess:

“We posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn’t just something that happened in

Australia. It’s world history.”

The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally III law has left

physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have

breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right to life groups and the Australian Medical

Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn

back. In Australia — where an aging population, life extending technology and changing

community attitudes have all played their part — other states are going to consider making a

similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US and Canada, where the right to die movement is

gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling.

Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death — probably by a

deadly injection or pill — to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally

ill by two doctors. After a “cooling off” period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of

request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54 year old Darwin

resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally III law means he can get on with

living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition.

“I’m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I’d go,

224

because I’ve watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,”

he says.

52. When the author says that observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling, he means

_____.

[A] observers are taking a wait and see attitude towards the future of euthanasia

[B] similar bills are likely to be passed in the US, Canada and other countries

[C] observers are waiting to see the result of the game of dominoes

[D] the effect taking process of the passed bill may finally come to a stop

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第二段的最后一句话“In the US and Canada, where the right to die movement

is gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling”（在美国和加拿大，

死亡权利运动正在积蓄力量积极准备。观察家们正在等待着将产生的多米诺骨牌效应）。

“dominoes”的意思为多米诺骨牌，在这里指的是多米诺骨牌效应，即其他国家可能效仿澳

大利亚纷纷推出安乐死法律，因此答案为A。即使不知道dominoes 的意思，也可以从该句

的前半句以及第二段中间的“But the tide is unlikely to turn back”（但是安乐死这一潮流已

无法逆转）这句话也能判断出正确答案。A 和C 选项与上下文的意思不符，可以排除。而D

选项则与“But the tide is unlikely to turn back”这句话的意思以及该段的基调相反，也是错

误选项。

[题目译文]

作者说观察家们正在等待着将产生的多米诺骨牌效应，其中的意思是。

[A] 观察家们对安乐死的未来持观望态度

[B] 类似的法案可能会在美国、加拿大和其他国家通过

[C] 观察家们正在等待着看多米诺骨牌游戏的结束

[D] 这项已经同股哦的法案的生效过程最终可能会停止

53. When Lloyd Nickson dies, he will _____.

[A] face his death with calm characteristic of euthanasia

[B] experience the suffering of a lung cancer patient

225

[C] have an intense fear of terrible suffering

[D] undergo a cooling off period of seven days

[答案] A

[解题思路]

文章最后一段第四句指出“For Lloyd Nickson, a 54 year old Darwin resident suffering from lung

cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally III law means he can get on with living without the haunting

fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition”（对于居住于达尔文市、现

年54 岁的肺癌患者利奥德·尼克森来说，这个法律意味着他可以平静地生活下去而无须整

天惧怕即将来临的苦难折磨：因呼吸困难而在煎熬中痛苦地死去），显然B 选项是正确答

案。而B、C、D 选项都与原文意思相似，D 选项指的是安乐死执行过程中的一步，与例子

无关。

[题目译文]

当利奥德·尼克森死的时候，他会。

[A] 带着安乐死特有的平静面对死亡

[B] 经理肺癌患者的痛苦

[C] 非常害怕可怕的痛苦

[D] 经历七天的冷静期

**1997**年**Passage 2**

A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly, courteous, and helpful

most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and

Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small

minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it

is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment.

For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in

an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who

generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of

diversion, and brought news of the outside world.

The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling

alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin or settlement.

It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable impulse on the part of the

226

settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: if you didn’t take in the stranger and take care of

him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same

situation.

Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the weary traveler.

Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the

smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. “I was just traveling through, got

talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner — amazing.” Such

observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood

properly. The casual friendliness of many Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial

nor as artificial, but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition.

As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals, assumptions,

and conventions underlies all social interrelationships. And, of course, speaking a language does

not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. Visitors who fail to

“translate” cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example, when an

American uses the word “friend”, the cultural implications of the word may be quite different

from those it has in the visitor’s language and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a

bus to distinguish between courteous convention and individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a

virtue that many American value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers.

55. In the eyes of visitors from the outside world, _____.

[A] rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US

[B] small minded officials deserve a serious comment

[C] Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors

[D] most Americans are ready to offer help

[答案] D

[解题思路]

文章开篇第一句话指出“A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly,

courteous, and helpful most Americans were to them”（去过美国的人经常带回报告说，大多

数美国人对他们非常友善、好客、且他们都很乐于助人），因此显而易见D 为正确答案。A

选项与第一段第四句话“There are, of course, exceptions. Small minded officials, rude waiters,

and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US”（在美国，心胸狭隘的官员，举止

粗鲁的招待和缺乏教养的出租车司机也并非罕见）的意思相反。B 选项与原文不符，因为第

一段最后一句话提到的“deserve comments”指的是美国人对人热情友好这一现象。而C 选

227

项与该段第二句话“To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians,

and should best be considered North American”（公正地说，人们对加拿大和加拿大人也有这

样的评论，因而，应当认为这是北美一个普遍的现象）的意思相反，也是错误选项。

[题目译文]

在外来游客的眼中， 。

[A] 粗鲁的出租车司机在美国很少见

[B] 心胸狭窄的官员们应该得到严肃的批评

[C] 加拿大人们不如他们的邻国人友好

[D] 大多数美国人都乐于助人

57. Families in frontier settlements used to entertain strangers _____.

A) to improve their hard life

B) in view of their long distance travel

C) to add some flavor to their own daily life

D) out of a charitable impulse

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第二段的最后一句话“Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of

diversion, and brought news of the outside world”（因此陌生人和旅行者很受欢迎，他们给当

地人带来了娱乐消遣，同时还带来了外面世界的消息），因此C 选项为正确答案，选项中

的flavor 与原文的diversion 对应。

[题目译文]

在偏远地区的人家过去款待陌生人的原因在于。

[A] 为了改善他们的艰苦生活

[B] 由于游客长途跋涉

[C] 为了该自己的日常生活增添一些特色

[D] 一时冲动做好事

58. The tradition of hospitality to strangers _____.

228

[A] tends to be superficial and artificial

[B]) is generally well kept up in the United States

[C] is always understood properly

[D] was something to do with the busy tourist trails

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章第四段，该段第二句话说“Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to

strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the

busy tourist trails”（不过，热情接待陌生人的传统在美国仍然非常流行，尤其是在远离旅游

热线的小城镇），选项符合题意，而D 选项与该句的意思相左。A 选型与该段最后一句话

“The casual friendliness of many Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial nor as

artificial, but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition”（很多美国人在不经意间

表现出的友好不应被看做是表面应酬或故作姿态，而应该视为是在历史发展中形成的一种文

化传统）意思相反，是错误选项。C 选项与该段倒数第二句话“Such observations reported by

visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly”（来美国的旅客中

碰到这种事件的还不少，但他们并非对这个现象都能正确理解）的意思也是相反的，因而也

是错误的。

[题目译文]

款待陌生人的传统。

[A] 往往是肤浅的、虚伪的

[B] 总的来说在美国很好地保持了下来

[C] 总是得到正确的理解

[D] 与繁忙的旅游路线有关

**1997**年**Passage 3**

Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or mental functioning is a drug.

Many people mistakenly believe the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine or an illegal

chemical taken by drug addicts. They don’t realize that familiar substances such as alcohol and

tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is now used by many

physicians and psychologists. The phrase “substance abuse” is often used instead of “drug abuse”

229

to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as harmfully misused as

heroin and cocaine.

We live a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances (drugs) is pervasive: an

aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a

cigarette for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently constructive uses of a

substance become misuses? First of all, most substances taken in excess will produce negative

effects such as poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a substance can also

lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence is marked first by an increased

tolerance, with more and more of the substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by

the appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued.

Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and

behavior are known as psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are commonly grouped

according to whether they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants initially speed

up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants slow it down. Hallucinogens have

their primary effect on perception, distorting and altering it in a variety of ways including

producing hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic (from the Greek word

meaning “mind-manifesting”) because they seemed to radically alter one’s state of consciousness.

59. “Substance abuse” (Line 5, Paragraph 1) is preferable to “drug abuse” in that _____.

[A] substances can alter our bodily or mental functioning if illegally used

[B] “drug abuse” is only related to a limited number of drug takers

[C] alcohol and tobacco are as fatal as heroin and cocaine

[D] many substances other than heroin or cocaine can also be poisonous

[答案] D

[解题思路]

第一段第三句至最后一句指出“They don’t realize that familiar substances such as alcohol and

tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is now used by many

physicians and psychologists. The phrase “substance abuse” is often used instead of “drug abuse”

to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as harmfully misused as

heroin and cocaine”（他们没有意识到诸如酒精、烟草这些我们熟悉的物质也都是药物。这

也就是为什么现在许多医生和心理学家使用“物质”这个更加中性的词的原因。他们常用“物

质滥用”而不用“药物滥用”来清楚表明滥用酒精、烟草这样的物质与滥用海洛因和可卡因

一样有害），因此用“Substance abuse”比“drug abuse”更好的原因在于如果人们也滥用酒精和

230

烟草等物质，与毒品一样是有害的，因此D 为正确选项。C 选项的错误在于alcohol 和tabacco

只是例子，且文章没有提及它们是否fatal。而A 和B 选项都不符合题意。

[题目译文]

使用“物质滥用”（第一段第五行）这个词语比“药物滥用”更合适是因为。

[A] 物质如果非常使用会改变我们的身体和心理机能

[B] “药物滥用”只与少数吸毒者有关

[C] 酒精和烟草与海洛因和可卡因具有一样的致命性

[D] 除了海洛因和可卡因之外，还有很多物质也有毒性

61. Physical dependence on certain substances results from _____.

[A] uncontrolled consumption of them over long periods of time

[B] exclusive use of them for social purposes

[C] quantitative application of them to the treatment of diseases

[D] careless employment of them for unpleasant symptoms

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题可定位于文章第二段的倒数第二句话“Repeated use of a substance can also lead to

physical addiction or substance dependence”（反复使用一种物质可以导致上瘾），显然A 为

正确答案。B 选项的情况有一定干扰性，但与原文意思有所不同。而C、D 都不是题干中

“Physical dependence on certain substances”的原因。

[题目译文]

对于某些物质的心理依赖是由于。

[A] 长时间对于这些物质的无节制使用

[B] 专为社交目的使用这些物质

[C] 将这些物质大量应用于疾病治疗

[D] 随意用它们来消除难受的症状

**1997**年**Passage 4**

231

No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral decline of a nation. “Is this what you

intended to accomplish with your careers?” Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner executives

last week. “You have sold your souls, but must you corrupt our nation and threaten our children as

well?” At Time Warner, however, such questions are simply the latest manifestation of the soul

searching that has involved the company ever since the company was born in 1990. It’s a selfexamination

that has, at various times, involved issues of responsibility, creative freedom and the

corporate bottom line.

At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who took over for the late Steve Ross

in 1992. On the financial front, Levin is under pressure to raise the stock price and reduce the

company’s mountainous debt, which will increase to 17.3 billion after two new cable deals

close. He has promised to sell off some of the property and restructure the company, but investors

are waiting impatiently.

The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin has consistently defended the

company’s rap music on the grounds of expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under fire

for releasing Ice T’s violent rap song Cop Killer, Levin described rap as a lawful expression of

street culture, which deserves an outlet. “The test of any democratic society,” he wrote in a Wall

Street Journal column, “lies not in how well it can control expression but in whether it gives

freedom of thought and expression the widest possible latitude, however disputable or irritating

the results may sometimes be. We won’t retreat in the face of any threats.”

Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were signs that the chairman was

backing off his hard line stand, at least to some extent. During the discussion of rock singing

verses at last month’s stockholders’ meeting, Levin asserted that “music is not the cause of

society’s ills” and even cited his son, a teacher in the Bronx, New York, who uses rap to

communicate with students. But he talked as well about the “balanced struggle” between creative

freedom and social responsibility, and he announced that the company would launch a drive to

develop standards for distribution and labeling of potentially objectionable music.

The 15 member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin and his corporate strategy.

But insiders say several of them have shown their concerns in this matter. “Some of us have

known for many, many years that the freedoms under the First Amendment are not totally

unlimited,” says Luce. “I think it is perhaps the case that some people associated with the

company have only recently come to realize this.”

63. Senator Robert Dole criticized Time Warner for _____.

[A] its raising of the corporate stock price

[B] its self examination of soul

232

[C] its neglect of social responsibility

[D] its emphasis on creative freedom

[答案] C

[解题思路]

文章第一段第二句话““Is this what you intended to accomplish with your careers?” Senator

Robert Dole asked Time Warner executives last week. “You have sold your souls, but must you

corrupt our nation and threaten our children as well?””（上星期，参议员罗伯特·多尔质问时

代--华纳公司的高级经理们时说：“难道这就是你们要成就的事业吗？你们已经出卖了自己

的灵魂，难道你们还一定要腐化我们这个民族，威胁我们的下一代吗？”），四个选项中只

有C 选项符合引言的基调和思想。

[题目译文]

参议员罗伯特·多尔批评时代华纳公司是因为。

[A] 该公司提高其股票价格

[B] 公司在良心上的自我反省

[C] 公司忽略了社会责任

[D] 公司强调创造性自由

64. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?

[A] Luce is a spokesman of Time Warner.

[B] Gerald Levin is liable to compromise.

[C] Time Warner is united as one in the face of the debate.

[D] Stever Ross is no longer alive

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题可以一一排除。关于A 选项，Luce 出现在文章的最后一段，之前的一句话指出“But

insiders say several of them have shown their concerns in this matter”（但据内部消息人士透露，

其中有几位董事对此事表示担忧），由此可以推测Luce 可能是董事之一，因此A 选项错误。

B 选项对应于文章的第四段，其中第一句话指出“Levin would not comment on the debate last

week, but there were signs that the chairman was backing off his hard line stand, at least to some

extent”（莱文不愿对上周的评论做出评论，但有迹象表明这位董事长的强硬立场起码在一

233

定程度上有所松动），虽然说Levin 的立场有所松动，但只是“to some extent”，因此B 选

项的表述并不完全正确。C 选项对应于最后一段的前面两句话“The 15 member Time Warner

board is generally supportive of Levin and his corporate strategy. But insiders say several of them

have shown their concerns in this matter”（总的来说，时代--华纳公司的15 位董事是支持莱

文和公司的经营策略的。但据内部消息人士透露，其中有几位董事对此事表示担忧），尽管

表面上上下齐心，但是实际上情况并不是如此，因此C 选项也是错误的。D 选项的Stever Ross

出现在文章第二段，其名字前面用了late 的意思，在英文里面这种用法就是指这个人已经亡

故，因此D 选项符合题意。

[题目译文]

根据文章内容，下列那一项是正确的？

[A] 卢斯是时代华纳公司的一名发言人。

[B] 杰罗德·莱文可能会妥协。

[C] 时代华纳公司面对这场辩论上下齐心

[D] 史蒂夫·罗斯已经离开了人世。

65. In face of the recent attacks on the company, the chairman _____.

[A] stuck to a strong stand to defend freedom of expression

[B] softened his tone and adopted some new policy

[C] changed his attitude and yielded to objection

[D] received more support from the 15 member board

[答案] B

[解题思路]

文章第四段一开始就指出，董事长在某种程度上缓和了其强硬立场，此外该段最后一句进一

步指出“he announced that the company would launch a drive to develop standards for

distribution and labeling of potentially objectionable music”（他还宣布，公司将全力为那些可

能引起人们反感的音乐制定各种发行和标识的标准），因此可见正确答案为B，其余三项也

相应地可以排除。

[题目译文]

面对公司近期收到的攻击，董事长。

[A] 坚持其强硬立场，维护言论自由

234

[B] 缓和了语气并采取了新的政策

[C] 改变了他的态度并接受了批评意见

[D] 从15 名董事会成员那里得到了更多的支持

**1997**年**Passage 5**

Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as “steering the economy to a soft

landing” or “a touch on the brakes”, makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could be

further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain. And there are long,

variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the analogy that

likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear

view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.

Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of late.

Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its

lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way below the

double digit rates which many countries experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s.

It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists which

The Economist polls each month said that America’s inflation rate would average 3.5% in 1995.

In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and expected to average only about 3% for the year as a whole.

In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end

of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, inflation has been

consistently lower than expected in Britain and America.

Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and the

United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially America’s,

have little productive slack. America’s capacity utilization, for example, his historically high

levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen bellow most estimates of

the natural rate of unemployment — the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past.

Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a little

defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have up ended the

old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation.

68. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?

[A] Making monetary policies is comparable to driving a car

[B] An extremely low jobless rate will lead to inflation

235

[C] A high unemployment rate will result from inflation

[D] Interest rates have an immediate effect on the economy

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可对选项进行一一排除。文章第一段最后一句话说“Hence the analogy that likens the

conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear view

mirror and a faulty steering wheel.”（因此，人们将货币政策的实施比做是驾驶一辆带有灰暗

挡风玻璃、后视镜破碎及方向盘失灵的汽车），而A 选项中的“Making monetary policies”

与原文中的“the conduct of monetary policy”是不同的，前者指的是“金融政策的制定”，

而后者指的是“金融政策的实施”，因而可以首先排除A 选项。文章第一段第三句话指出

“The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain”（利率和通货膨胀之间的关系并不

是确定的），因此可以排除D 选项。B 和C 选项的表述是相反的意思，其对应的信息在文

章第四段的最后“its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen bellow most estimates of the natural

rate of unemployment — the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past”（而在过去的

时候，当失业率降到低于自然失业率时，通货膨胀率早已飙升），因此B 是正确选项。

[题目译文]

根据文章，下面哪个选项是正确的？

[A] 制定货币政策就好比开车。

[B] 极低的失业率会导致通货膨胀。

[C] 高失业率是由通货膨胀造成的。

[D] 利率对于经济有立竿见影的影响。

**1998**年**Passage 1**

Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is

humankind’s long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the ideal of forcing the

waters to do our bidding so fascination. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind.

Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good.

The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn’t help that building a big,

powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to assert

themselves. Egypt’s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam.

Turkey’s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.

236

But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example stopped the Nile

flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left - all in return for a giant reservoir of

disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.

And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized Europe,

Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam

on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of big dams. But

Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs a dam to prove itself.

Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go ahead to the even more wrong headed

Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will cause

hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the powerful, but

they are far from guaranteed.

Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of controlling water

can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are

possible without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it is hard to be

either proper, or scientific. It is time that the world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don’t need

a dam to be saved.

53. What is the myth concerning giant dams?

[A] They bring in more fertile soil.

[B]) They help defend the country.

[C]) They strengthen international ties.

[D] They have universal control of the waters.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

文章第四段第一句话用到了myth 这个词，“And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists”

（不过，制服洪水的神话仍在继续），可见，myth 指的就是controlling the waters，因此答

案显然是D。

[题目译文]

关于大型水坝的神话是什么？

[A] 它们会带来更加肥沃的土壤

[B] 它们可以保卫国家

[C] 它们可以加强国际关系

237

[D] 它们能全面控制洪水

**1998**年**Passage 2**

Well, no gain without pain, they say. But what about pain without gain? Everywhere you go in

America, you hear tales of corporate revival. What is harder to establish is whether the

productivity revolution that businessmen assume they are presiding over is for real.

The official statistics are mildly discouraging. They show that, if you lump manufacturing and

services together, productivity has grown on average by 1.2% since 1987. That is somewhat faster

than the average during the previous decade. And since 1991, productivity has increased by about

2% a year, which is more than twice the 1978 87 average. The trouble is that part of the recent

acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this point in a business cycle, and so is not

conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying trend. There is, as Robert Rubin, the treasury

secretary, says, a “disjunction” between the mass of business anecdote that points to a leap in

productivity and the picture reflected by the statistics.

Some of this can be easily explained. New ways of organizing the workplace all that re

engineering and downsizing - are only one contribution to the overall productivity of an economy,

which is driven by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment and machinery, new

technology, and investment in education and training. Moreover, most of the changes that

companies make are intended to keep them profitable, and this need not always mean increasing

productivity: switching to new markets or improving quality can matter just as much.

Two other explanations are more speculative. First, some of the business restructuring of recent

years may have been ineptly done. Second, even if it was well done, it may have spread much less

widely than people suppose.

Leonard Schlesinger, a Harvard academic and former chief executive of Au Bong Pain, a

rapidly growing chain of bakery cafes, says that much “re engineering” has been crude. In many

cases, he believes, the loss of revenue has been greater than the reductions in cost. His colleague,

Michael Beer, says that far too many companies have applied re engineering in a mechanistic

fashion, chopping out costs without giving sufficient thought to long term profitability. BBDO’s

Al Rosenshine is blunter. He dismisses a lot of the work of re engineering consultants as mere

rubbish - “the worst sort of ambulance cashing.”

55. According to the author, the American economic situation is _____ .

[A][not as good as it seems

[B] at its turning point

238

[C ]much better than it seems

[D] near to complete recovery

[答案] A

[解题思路]

文章第一段最后一句话指出“What is harder to establish is whether the productivity revolution

that businessmen assume they are presiding over is for real”（但是，更加难以确定的是商家自

认为他们发动的这场生产率革命是否真的名副其实），紧接着第二段第五句话进一步认为

“The trouble is that part of the recent acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this

point in a business cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying trend”

（而问题在于，近年出现的生产力快速增长部分是由于商业周期通常到了这时候常出现的反

弹造成的，因而还不能以此作为最终的证据来证明这种趋势预示出经济复苏的姿态），这些

都说明了作者并不认为美国经济已经从根本上复苏，现在看到的只是表面现象，因而A 为

正确选项。做好本题的关键就是要抓住这些分布在不同地方的相关信息，理解长句的含义并

将它们结合起来一起帮助做题。

[题目译文]

文章作者认为美国的经济形势是。

[A] 不如看起来那么好

[B] 正处于转折点

[C] 比看起来好多了

[D] 接近完全的复苏

56. The official statistics on productivity growth _____ .

[A] exclude the usual rebound in a business cycle

[B]) fall short of businessmen’s anticipation

[C] meet the expectation of business people

[D] fail to reflect the true state of economy

[答案] B

[解题思路]

239

本文对应的信息主要在文章的第二段，可以采用排除法一一排除。首先，第一句话说“The

official statistics are mildly discouraging”（官方的统计数字却有点不容乐观），显然C 选项

与该句的意思相左。另外，该段最后一句话指出“There is, as Robert Rubin, the treasury

secretary, says, a “disjunction” between the mass of business anecdote that points to a leap in

productivity and the picture reflected by the statistics”（正如财政部长罗伯特·鲁宾所说的那

样，生产力发生大幅提高的商业传奇与官方的统计数字所反映的情况之间存在着一种“脱

节”），因此官方数据重点是与business anecdote 的情况相异，但与business cycle 和state of

economy 无关，因此A、D 选项都可以排除。B 选项中“fall short of”是“没有达到，不符

合”的意思，符合原文的语境。

[题目译文]

关于生产力增长的官方统计数据。

[A] 没有包括商业周期中通常出现的反弹

[B] 没有达到商人们的预期

[C] 达到了商人们的预期

[D] 没有反映出经济的真实状况

57. The author raises the question “what about pain without gain?” because _____ .

[A] he questions the truth of “no gain without pain”

[B] he does not think the productivity revolution works

[C] he wonders if the official statistics are misleading

[D] he has conclusive evidence for the revival of businesses

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可以采用排除法。题干提到的这句话出现在文章的第一句，是作者用来引出话题的，而

并不是文章的主题，因此A 选项首先可以排除。关于C 选项，文章第二段的开头说到“The

official statistics are mildly discouraging”（官方的统计数字却有点不容乐观），但是

discouraging 并不代表misleading，所以C 选项也错误。关于D 选项，第二段第五句话认为

“The trouble is that part of the recent acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this

point in a business cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying trend”，

因此D 选项与原文意思相反，是错误选项。文章最后一句指出“He dismisses a lot of the work

of re engineering consultants as mere rubbish - “the worst sort of ambulance cashing.””（BBDO

240

的艾尔·罗森夏恩更加直率，他把许多重组咨询专家所做的工作视为垃圾——“典型的劳而

无获”），可见作者对于生产力革命是持否定态度的，因此正确选项为B。

[题目译文]

作者提出了“如果是有劳无获呢？”这个问题的原因是。

[A] 他怀疑“不劳而获”这一说法的真实性

[B] 他认为生产力革命不起作用

[C] 他怀疑官方的统计数据有误导作用

[D] 他有关于经济复苏的确凿证据

58. Which of the following statements is NOT mentioned in the passage?

[A] Radical reforms are essential for the increase of productivity.

[B] New ways of organizing workplaces may help to increase productivity.

[C] The reduction of costs is not a sure way to gain long term profitability.

[D] The consultants are a bunch of good for nothings.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题要求选择在文章中没有提到的说法，因此应该与原文一一对应采用排除法来排除。首先，

文章第三段第二句话指出：“New ways of organizing the workplace all that re engineering and

downsizing - are only one contribution to the overall productivity of an economy, which is driven

by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment and machinery, new technology, and

investment in education and training”（新的工作场所组织方式——包括所有那些重组和缩小

规模的做法——只是促进某一个经济实体的综合生产力水平的一项措施，而这种生产力的提

高还受到许多其他因素的驱动，如对机械设备的联合投资，采用新技术，以及在教育和培训

上的投资），因此可见B 选项与该句意思吻合，是对该句的一个简要概括，因此B 选项表

述正确。C 和D 选项分别对应于文章最后一段的最后两句话，“His colleague, Michael Beer,

says that far too many companies have applied re engineering in a mechanistic fashion, chopping

out costs without giving sufficient thought to long term profitability”（他的同事迈克·比尔说，

太多的公司用简单机械的方式进行重组，在没有充分考虑到长期赢利能力的情况下降低了成

本）和“He dismisses a lot of the work of re engineering consultants as mere rubbish - “the worst

sort of ambulance cashing.””（BBDO 的艾尔·罗森夏恩更加直率，他把许多重组咨询专家

241

所做的工作视为垃圾——“典型的劳而无获”），因此这两个选项的表述都是正确的。而A

选项在文中则没有明确的对应信息，因此答案为A。

[题目译文]

下面哪一项说法没有在文中提到？

[A] 激进的改革对生产力的提高十分重要。

[B] 企业重组的新方式可能有助于提高生产力。

[C] 降低成本并不能保证获得长期的效益。

[D] 那些咨询顾问都是没有的人

**1998**年**Passage 3**

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of Gallileo’s

17th century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake’s harsh

remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism between science and the

humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.

Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore its critics

- but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have attacked “antiscience” in

several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R.Gross, a biologist at the University of

Verginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers University; and The Demon Haunted

World, by Car Sagan of Cornell University.

Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as “The Flight from

Science and Reason,” held in New York City in 1995, and “Science in the Age of

(Mis)information,” which assembled last June near Buffalo.

Antiscience clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find fault

primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned science’s

objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other

phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.

A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the antiscience tag has been attached to many

other groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks

of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.

Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, those manifesto, published in 1995,

scorns science and longs for return to a pretechnological utopia. But surely that does not mean

environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are antiscience, as an essay in

US News & World Report last May seemed to suggest.

242

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science, argues

Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question

the evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other consequences

of industrial growth.

Indeed, some observers fear that the antiscience epithet is in danger of becoming meaningless.

“The term ‘antiscience’ can lump together too many, quite different things,” notes Harvard

University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science and Anti Science. “They have in

common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard themselves as more

enlightened.”

61. Which of the following is true according to the passage?

[A] Environmentalists were blamed for antiscience in an essay.

[B] Politicians are not subject to the labeling of antiscience.

[C] The “more enlightened” tend to tag others as antiscience

[D] Tagging environmentalists as “antiscience” is justifiable

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题可以采用排除法。首先，文章第五段指出“A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the

antiscience tag has been attached to many other groups as well, from authorities who advocated

the elimination of the last remaining stocks of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated

decreased funding for basic research”（1996 年对新闻报道的调查表明，反科学的标签也贴在

了许多其他群体上，从提倡消灭所有现存的天花病毒的官员到鼓吹削减基础研究基金的共和

党人），而B 选项的表述与这句话是矛盾的，因此B 是错误选项。C 选项与文章最后一句

话“They have in common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard

themselves as more enlightened”（它们惟一的共同点就是会激怒或威胁那些自以为比别人更

高明的人），C 选项与该表述不一致。文章第六段最后一句话指出“But surely that does not

mean environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are antiscience, as an

essay in US News & World Report last May seemed to suggest”（当然，这并不意味着，对不

加控制的工业发展表示担忧的环境主义者也是反科学的，而去年5 月份刊登在《美国新闻和

世界报导》的一篇文章似乎有此暗示），D 选项与这个句子的意思正好相反，也可以排除。

而A 选项则正好符合第六段最后一句话的内容，是正确选项。

[题目译文]

243

下列哪一项符合文意？

[A] 环保主义者们在一篇文章中被指责为反科学。

[B] 很难给政治家们贴上反科学的标签。

[C] “那些更有学识的人”更会给别人贴上反科学的标签。

[D] 给环保主义者贴上反科学的标签是有道理的。

**1998**年**Passage 4**

Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing more and more regional

competition, as population growth in the Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill.

This development - and its strong implications for US politics and economy in years ahead - has

enthroned the South as America’s most densely populated region for the first time in the history of

the nation’s head counting.

Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million people - numerically the third

largest growth ever recorded in a single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4 percent,

lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.

Americans have been migrating south and west in larger number since World War II, and the

pattern still prevails.

Three sun belt states - Florida, Texas and California - together had nearly 10 million more

people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th and

San Antonio from 15th to 10th - with Cleveland and Washington.DC, dropping out of the top 10.

Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow belt, census officials say,

Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too - and so did bigger crops of babies as yesterday’s

“baby boom” generation reached its child bearing years.

Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a related but

newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for places with

more jobs but with fewer people, too. Some instances-

● Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid growth rate - 37.1

percent since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population.

●Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1 percent

respectively. Except fro Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is composed of Western

states with 7.5 million people - about 9 per square mile.

The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow belt to more bearable

climates.

Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious living than

244

in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, more than any

other state.

In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, mostly to other parts of

the West. Often they chose - and still are choosing - somewhat colder climates such as Oregon,

Idaho and Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization in the Golden

State.

As a result, California’s growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 18.5 percent - little more than

two thirds the 1960s’ growth figure and considerably below that of other Western states.

63. Discerned from the perplexing picture of population growth the 1980 census provided,

America in 1970s _____.

[A] enjoyed the lowest net growth of population in history

[B] witnessed a southwestern shift of population

[C] underwent an unparalleled period of population growth

[D] brought to a standstill its pattern of migration since World War II

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可采用排除法。首先，第三段最后一句话指出“Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4

percent, lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years”（即使如此，人口

总数也只增加了11.4％，除了大萧条时期，这是美国最低的年度增长率），因此A 选项是

错误的，可以排除。C 选项在文章中没有提及。而文章第四段指出“Americans have been

migrating south and west in larger number since World War II, and the pattern still prevails”（自

从第二次世界大战以来，美国人口一直大量向南部和西部迁移，而且至今这种趋势仍然盛

行），D 选项的表述与原文相反，因而也是错误的。而A 选项符合上面的第四段话的信息，

因而是正确答案。

[题目译文]

1980 年人口普查后提供的令人费解的描述中，20 世纪70 年代的美国。

[A] 经历了历史上最低的人口净增长

[B] 见证了人口向该国西南部分的迁移

[C] 经历了一个无可比拟的人口增长期

[D] 终结了二战以来的迁移模式

245

64. The census distinguished itself from previous studies on population movement in that _____ .

A) it stresses the climatic influence on population distribution

B) it highlights the contribution of continuous waves of immigrants

C) it reveals the Americans’ new pursuit of spacious living

D) it elaborates the delayed effects of yesterday’s “baby boom”

[答案] C

[解题思路]

文章第七段明确指出“demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a

related but newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for

places with more jobs but with fewer people, too”（人口统计学家发现，向南部和西部的不断

迁移还伴随着一种与此相关却又与以往不同的现象：越来越多的美国人显然不再仅仅寻找有

更多就业机会的地方，他们也在寻找人口稀少的地方），因此C 选项符合原文的意思。文

章中并没有强调天气和移民潮的贡献，因此A 和B 选项比较容易排除。此外，虽然文章提

到了baby boom，但是这并不是作者主要讨论的话题，作者只是顺带而过，并没有“elaborate”。

[题目译文]

这次人口普查与之前的人口流动研究的区别在于。

[A] 它强调气候对人口分布的影响

[B] 它强调不断的移民潮的贡献所在

[C] 它揭示了美国人对于宽敞住房的新追求

[D] 它详尽阐述了过去“婴儿潮”的滞后影响

**1998**年**Passage 5**

Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity known

to geologists as hot spots. Unlike most of the world’s volcanoes, they are not always found at the

boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up the earth’s surface; on the contrary, many of

them lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the hot spots move only slowly, and in some cases

the movement of the plates past them has left trails of dead volcanoes. The hot spots and their

volcanic trails are milestones that mark the passage of the plates.

That the plates are moving is not beyond dispute. Africa and South America, for example, are

moving away from each other as new material is injected into the sea floor between them. The

246

complementary coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the ocean are

reminders of where the two continents were once joined. The relative motion of the plates carrying

these continents has been constructed in detail, but the motion of one plate with respect to another

cannot readily be translated into motion with respect to the earth’s interior. It is not possible to

determine whether both continents are moving in opposite directions or whether one continent is

stationary and the other is drifting away from it. Hot spots, anchored in the deeper layers of the

earth, provide the measuring instruments needed to resolve the question. From an analysis of the

hot spot population it appears that the African plate is stationary and that it has not moved during

the past 30 million years.

The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role as a frame of reference. It now appears

that they also have an important influence on the geophysical processes that propel the plates

across the globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, the material rising from

deeper layer creates a broad dome. As the dome grows, it develops seed fissures (cracks); in at

least a few cases the continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, so that the hot spot

initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus just as earlier theories have explained the mobility of

the continents, so hot spots may explain their mutability (inconstancy).

67. The author believes that _____.

[A] the motion of the plates corresponds to that of the earth’s interior

[B]) the geological theory about drifting plates has been proved to be true

[C] the hot spots and the plates move slowly in opposite directions

[D] the movement of hot spots proves the continents are moving apart

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题也需要与文章具体内容进行一一对应以便排除错误选项。首先，第二段第四句话谈到

“The relative motion of the plates carrying these continents has been constructed in detail, but the

motion of one plate with respect to another cannot readily be translated into motion with respect to

the earth’s interior”（带着两个大陆板块漂移的相对运动已经能够被详细地阐述出来，但一

个板块相对另一板块的运动还不能轻易地解释为它们相对于地球内部的运动），因此A 选

项显然与原文表述是矛盾的。接下来第五句话进一步说“It is not possible to determine whether

both continents are moving in opposite directions or whether one continent is stationary and the

other is drifting away from it”（人们还不能确定两个大陆是在朝相反的方向运动，也不能确

定是否一个大陆停止不动而另一个离它而去），因此C、D 选项也与原文不符合。而第二段

247

第一句话明确指出“That the plates are moving is not beyond dispute”（板块漂移这一理论现

在是无可争辩的了），可见B 选项符合正确答案。

[题目译文]

作者相信。

[A] 板块的移动与地球内部的移动是一致的

[B] 关于板块漂移的地质理论已经被证明是正确的

[C] 热区和板块朝着相反的方向缓慢移动

[D] 热区的移动证明了大陆正在彼此分开

68. That Africa and South America were once joined can be deduced from the fact that _____ .

[A] the two continents are still moving in opposite directions

[B] they have been found to share certain geological features

[C] the African plates has been stable for 30 million years

[D] over 100 hot spots are scattered all around the globe

[答案] B

[解题思路]

Africa 和South America 的例子对应于文章第二段的第二、三句话“Africa and South America,

for example, are moving away from each other as new material is injected into the sea floor

between them. The complementary coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the

ocean are reminders of where the two continents were once joined”（以非洲和南美洲为例，由

于有新的物质嵌入二者之间的海底，两个大洲之间的距离越来越远。但互相吻合的海岸线和

某些似乎跨越海洋的地质特征会使人想到这两个大陆曾经是连成一片的），因此很容易定位

正确答案为B。

[题目译文]

能够证明非洲和南美洲曾经相连的事实是。

[A] 这两块大陆仍然在朝相反的方向漂移

[B] 人们发现它们有某些相同的地质特征

[C] 非洲板块已经稳定了3000 万年

[D] 全球散布着100 多个热区

248

69. The hot spot theory may prove useful in explaining _____ .

[A] the structure of the African plates

[B] the revival of dead volcanoes

[C] the mobility of the continents

[D] the formation of new oceans

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本文可以采用排除法。首先，A 选项在文章中没有提及，B 选项的“dead vocalnoes”也是在

文章第一段最后顺带提及，并不是用热区理论要解释的现象。文章最后一句话提到“as earlier

theories have explained the mobility of the continents”（正像早期的理论解释了大陆的可移动

性一样），说明大陆移动性不需要用热区理论来解释，而是用早期理论解释，因此C 选项

错误。D 选项对应于文章最后一段倒数第二句话“As the dome grows, it develops seed fissures

(cracks); in at least a few cases the continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, so

that the hot spot initiates the formation of a new ocean”（至少有几次，大陆可能会沿着其中的

一些裂缝完全裂开了，因此这个热区就引发了一个新海洋的形成），因而D 是正确答案。

[题目译文]

热区理论可能有力地解释。

[A] 非洲板块的结构

[B] 死火山的复活

[C] 大陆的移动性

[D] 新大洋的形成

**1999**年**Passage l**

It’s a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a leg slipping on your doormat.

Light up the stove and you could burn down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to

warn of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for your troubles. Or so the

thinking has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began holding more companies liable for

their customers’ misfortunes.

Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to

anticipate every possible accident. Today, stepladders carry labels several inches long that warn,

249

among other things, that you might-surprise! --fall off. The label on a child’s Batman cape

cautions that the toy "does not enable user to fly."

While warnings are often appropriate and necessary--the dangers of drug interactions, for

example--and many are required by state or federal regulations, it isn’t clear that they actually

protect the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. About 50 percent of

the companies lose when injured customers take them to court.

Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue as before, some courts

are beginning to side with defendants, especially in cases where a warning label probably

wouldn’t have changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt Sports in Illinois,

successfully fought a lawsuit involving a football player who was paralyzed in a game while

wearing a Schutt helmet. "We’re really sorry he has become paralyzed, but helmets aren’t

designed to prevent those kinds of injuries, "says Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature of the

game, not the helmet, was the reason for the athlete’s injury. At the same time, the American Law

Institute--a group of judges, lawyers, and academics whose recommendations carry substantial

weight-issued new guidelines for tort law stating that companies need not warn customers of

obvious dangers or bombard them with a lengthy list of possible ones. "Important information can

get buried in a sea of trivialities," says a law professor at Cornell law School who helped draft the

new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal community has its way, the information on

products might actually be provided for the benefit of customers and not as protection against

legal liability.

51. What were things like in 1980s when accidents happened?

[A] Customers might be relieved of their disasters through lawsuits.

[B] Injured customers could expect protection from the legal system.

[C] Companies would avoid being sued by providing new warnings.

[D] Juries tended to find fault with the compensations companies promised.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章的第一段最后一句话“Or so the thinking has gone since the early 1980s,

when juries began holding more companies liable for their customers’ misfortunes”（大约自80

年代初以来这种想法开始日渐流行，因为从那时起陪审团开始认为更多的公司应对其顾客所

遭受的不幸负责），因此B 选项符合题意。C 和D 选项与该句的意思不符。至于A 选项，

该段第四句提到“Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to warn of coming disaster, a successful

250

lawsuit might compensate you for your troubles”（但是假如门垫或炉灶上没有警示语告诉你

可能发生的危害，你或许可以就自己所受的伤害通过法律诉讼，成功地获得赔偿），但获得

赔偿并不意味着A 选项的relieved of their disasters（免除了他们的灾难），因为无论如何赔

偿都是事后的，灾难已经发生了、无需通过赔偿避免。

[题目译文]

在20 世纪80 年代的时候，如果发生事故会怎么样？

[A] 消费者可能通过诉讼从而免受灾难。

[B] 受伤的顾客可望获得法律制度的保护。

[C] 公司通过提供新的警示语以避免遭起诉。

[D] 陪审团更会从公司承诺的赔偿中挑毛病。

53. The case of Schutt helmet demonstrated that__

[A] some injury claims were no longer supported by law

[B] helmets were not designed to prevent injuries

[C] product labels would eventually be discarded

[D] some sports games might lose popularity with athletes

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题的例子主要在文章的第四段，该题前两句就提出“Now the tide appears to be turning. As

personal injury claims continue as before, some courts are beginning to side with defendants,

especially in cases where a warning label probably wouldn’t have changed anything”（现在看来

这种趋势正在转变。尽管个人伤害的指控一如既往还在继续，但有些法庭已开始站到被告一

方，特别是在处理那些即使有警示语也无法避免伤害的案件时），后面举了Schull helmet

的例子，用来论证该段开头的观点，因此正确选项是A。B 选项就事论事，不是说明举例的

目的，因而是错误选项。C 选项在文中没有直接或者相关的表述，而D 选项则与原文话题

无关。

[题目译文]

Schutt 头盔案证明。

[A] 有些受伤索赔不再得到法律支持

[B] 头盔不是用来预防受伤的

251

[C] 产品的警示语将最终被放弃

[D] 一些体育项目可能不再受运动员们欢迎

**1999**年**Passage 2**

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to tap the

consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies have

started to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such business-to-business sales

make sense because businesspeople typically know what product they’re looking for.

Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its

reliability. "Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them and the supplier,"

says senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are limiting the risk by

conducting online transactions only with established business partners who are given access to the

company’ s private internet .

Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available for

marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to "pull"

customers into sites. In the past year, however, software companies have developed tools that

allow companies to "push" information directly out to consumers, transmitting marketing

messages directly to targeted customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen saver

to deliver a continually updated stream of news and advertisements to subscribers’ computer

monitors. Subscribers can customize the information they want to receive and proceed directly to

a company’s Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are already starting to use similar

technologies to push messages to customers about special sales, product offerings, or other events.

But push technology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online culture thinks highly of

the notion that the information flowing onto the screen comes there by specific request. Once

commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction between the Web and

television fades. That’s a prospect that horrifies Net purists.

But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies to

make money. The examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show that a

Web site selling the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, hospitality, and

security will attract online customers. And the cost of computing power continues to free fall,

which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon. People looking back 5 or 10

years from now may well wonder why so few companies took the online plunge.

252

57. In the view of Net purists,__

[A] there should be no marketing messages in online culture

[B] money making should be given priority to on the Web

[C] the Web should be able to function as the television set

[D] there should be no online commercial information without requests

[答案] D

[解__________题思路]

Net purists 的例子出现在文章第三段最后一句话“That’s a prospect that horrifies Net purists”

（这种前景让网络净化者感到恐惧），进一步分析其对应信息应为上面的两句话“Online

culture thinks highly of the notion that the information flowing onto the screen comes there by

specific request. Once commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction

between the Web and television fades”（网上文化推崇这样一个概念，即流动到屏幕上的信

息应是在接到明确的请求之后才能出现的。一旦商业促销不请自来地充斥电脑屏幕，那么网

络和电视就没多大差别了）。因此这些人主张的是不应该出现不请自来的网络信息，因此D

选项符合原文。A 选项的错误在于这些Net purists 不是不要网上的推销信息，而是不希望它

们不请自来。B 选项与原文无关。C 选项的表述正好与Net purists 的观点相反，也是错误答

案。

[题目译文]

对于网络纯粹主义者来说， 。

[A] 在线文化中不应该包含营销信息

[B] 在网上应该给赚钱以优先考虑

[C] 网络应该能够起到和电视机一样的功能

[D] 商业信息不应该不请自来

**1999**年**Passage 3**

An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the classroom on the behalf of

students’ career prospects and those arguing for computers in the classroom for broader reasons of

radical educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have explored this distinction-indeed,

contradiction--which goes to the heart of what is wrong with the campaign to put computers in the

classroom.

An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of job is a technical education,

253

justified for reasons radically different from why education is universally required by law. It is not

simply to raise everyone’s job prospects that all children are legally required to attend school into

their teens. Rather, we have a certain conception of the American citizen, a character who is

incomplete if he cannot competently assess how his livelihood and happiness are affected by

things outside of himself. But this was not always the case; before it was legally required for all

children to attend school until a certain age, it was widely accepted that some were just not

equipped by nature to pursue this kind of education. With optimism characteristic of all

industrialized countries, we came to accept that everyone is fit to be educated. Computereducation

advocates forsake this optimistic notion for a pessimism that betrays their otherwise

cheery outlook. Banking on the confusion between educational and vocational reasons for

bringing computers into schools, computer-ed advocates often emphasize the job prospects of

graduates over their educational achievement.

There are some good arguments for a technical education given the right kind of student. Many

European schools introduce the concept of professional training early on in order to make sure

children are properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It is, however, presumptuous

to insist that there will only be so many jobs for so many scientists, so many businessmen, so

many accountants. Besides, this is unlikely to produce the needed number of every kind of

professional in a country as large as ours and where the economy is spread over so many states

and involves so many international corporations.

But, for a small group of students, professional training might be the way to go since welldeveloped

skills, all other factors being equal , can be the difference between having a job and not.

Of course, the basics of using any computer these days are very simple. It does not take a lifelong

acquaintance to pick up various software programs. If one wanted to become a computer engineer,

that is, of course, an entirely different story. Basic computer skills take--at the very longest-a

couple of months to learn. In any case, basic computer skills are only complementary to the host

of real skills that are necessary to becoming any kind of professional. It should be observed, of

course, that no school, vocational or not, is helped by a confusion over its purpose.

59. The author thinks the present rush to put computers in the classroom is__

[A] far-reaching

[B] dubiously oriented

[C] self-contradictory

[D] radically reformatory

[答案] B

文章的第一句话指出“An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the classroom

on the behalf of students’ career prospects and those arguing for computers in the classroom for

broader reasons of radical educational reform”（对于计算机课堂教学，人们在观点上存在着

一条无形的界限：一种观点是以学生的就业前景为理由，另一种是以激进的教育改革为理由、

希望借此从根本上改革教育制度）。该段进一步指出“Very few writers on the subject have

campaign to put computers in the classroom”（ 很少有人就这一区别——更确切地说是矛盾

——撰文进行探讨，但它却是促使计算机进入课堂运动出现问题的关键所在）。由此可知，

计算机教学的目的是职业教育还是教育改革的分界就不够明确。此外，作者在文章的最后一

句话指出“It should be observed, of course, that no school, vocational or not, is helped by a

confusion over its purpose”（当然应该看到的是，不管是职业学校还是普通学校，如果混淆

计算机教学的目的，就都不会受益）。因此，B 选项符合此意，是正确答案。C 选项有一定

干扰性，但是原文指的是计算机教育的良种目的之间相矛盾，并非计算机教育本身自相矛盾，

因此C 选项不正确。

[题目译文]

作者认为目前将计算机搬进课堂的潮流是。

[A] 意义深远的

[B] 方向不明确的

[C] 自相矛盾的

[D] 非常具有改革性

60. The belief that education is indispensable to all children__

[A] is indicative of a pessimism in disguise

[B] came into being along with the arrival of computers

[C] is deeply rooted in the minds of computer-ed advocates

[D]originated from the optimistic attitude of industrialized countries

[答案] D

[解题思路]

255

本题可采用排除法。A 选项对应于文章第二段的第六句话“Computer-education advocates

forsake this optimistic notion for a pessimism that betrays their otherwise cheery outlook”（而倡

导计算机教育的人们就抛弃了这一乐观理念，取而代之的是与他们乐观外表相悖的悲观论

调），选项的表述与原文不符。B 选项的“along with the arrival of computers”也与原文不符。

C 选项的表述与题干的意思无关。D 选项对应于第二段的第五句话“With optimism

characteristic of all industrialized countries, we came to accept that everyone is fit to be educated”

（随着工业化给国家带来的乐观主义精神，人们已经接受了人人都适合受教育的观念），显

然是正确答案。

[题目译文]

认为所有孩子必须接受教育的想法。

[A] 表明一种带着伪装的悲观主义

[B] 随着计算机的到来而实现了

[C] 在计算机教育倡导者的心中根深蒂固

[D] 来自工业化国家的乐观态度

62. According to the author, basic computer skills should be__

[A] included as an auxiliary course in school

[B] highlighted in acquisition of professional qualifications

[C]mastered through a life-long course

[D] equally emphasized by any school , vocational or otherwise

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章的最后一段倒数第二句话“In any case, basic computer skills are only

complementary to the host of real skills that are necessary to becoming any kind of professiona”

（不管怎样，基本的计算机技能只是对成为专业技术人员所需的各种实际技能的补充），A

选项中的auxiliary 对应于原文complementary，选项的表述与原文相符，是正确答案。B 和

C 选项都与该句意思相反，而D 选项则不符合文章最后一句话“It should be observed, of

course, that no school, vocational or not, is helped by a confusion over its purpose”（当然应该看

到的是，不管是职业学校还是普通学校，如果混淆计算机教学的目的，就都不会受益）的意

思，因为不需要在所有学校都强调计算机教育，以免造成“confusion over its purpose”。

根据本文作者，计算机基础技能应该。

[A] 被纳入学校的辅助课程

[B] 作为获得职业资格而受到重视

[C] 在一生中都要掌握

[D] 受到所有学校的一视同仁，包括职业学校和非职业学校

**1999**年**Passage 4**

When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months ago that it had cloned

an adult sheep, President Clinton moved swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this

unusual animal husbandry technique to clone humans, he ordered that federal funds not be used

for such an experiment-although no one had proposed to do so--and asked an independent panel of

experts chaired by Princeton President Harold Shapiro to report back to the White House in 90

days with recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. That group--the National

Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC)-has been working feverishly to put its wisdom on paper,

and at a meeting on 17 May, members agreed on a near-final draft of their recommendations.

NBAC will ask that Clinton’s 90-day ban on federal funds for human cloning be extended

indefinitely and possibly that it be made law. But NBAC members are planning to word the

recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research that involves the cloning of

human DNA or cells-routine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet reached agreement on a

crucial question, however, whether to recommend legislation that would make it a crime for

private funding to be used for human cloning.

In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro suggested

that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be "morally unacceptable to attempt to

create a human child by adult nuclear cloning." Shapiro explained during the meeting that the

moral doubt stems mainly from fears about the risk to the health of the child. The panel then

informally accepted several general conclusions, although some details have not been settled.

NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government funding for any attempt to clone

body cell nuclei to create a child. Because current federal law already forbids the use of federal

funds to create embryos ( the earliest stage of human offspring before birth) for research or to

knowingly endanger an embryo’ s life, NBAC will remain silent on embryo research.

NBAC members also indicated that they will appeal to privately funded researchers and clinics

not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were divided on whether to go

further by calling for a federal law that would impose a complete ban on human cloning. Shapiro

257

and most members favored an appeal for such legislation, but in a phone interview, he said this

issue was still "up in the air."

64. The panel agreed on all of the following except that__

[A] the ban on federal funds for human cloning should be made a law

[B] the cloning of human DNA is not to be put under more control

[C] it is criminal to use private funding for human cloning

[D] it would be against ethical values to clone a human being

[答案] C

[解题思路]

文章第二段最后一句指出“The panel has not yet reached agreement on a crucial question,

however, whether to recommend legislation that would make it a crime for private funding to be

used for human cloning”（但是，专家组尚未就一个关键问题达成一致，即是否建议立法把

将私人资金用于克隆人的行为视为犯罪），因此C 选项符合该句意思，是正确答案。其他

三个选项都是NBAC 已经达成共识的内容，其中A 选项对应于文章第二段第一句话“NBAC

will ask that Clinton’s 90-day ban on federal funds for human cloning be extended indefinitely

and possibly that it be made law”（NBAC 将要求克林顿总统禁止使用联邦资金克隆人的90

天禁令无限期地延长，并且还可能要求将之立法），B 选项对应于该段第二句话“But NBAC

members are planning to word the recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research

that involves the cloning of human DNA or cells-routine in molecular biology”（但是，NBAC

成员们计划在建议的措辞上更为严谨，以避免给克隆人体DNA 或细胞等研究带来更多地限

制——因为这是分子生物研究中的常规课题），D 选项对应于文章第三段第一句话“In a draft

preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro suggested that the

panel had found a broad consensus that it would be "morally unacceptable to attempt to create a

human child by adult nuclear cloning”（在5 月17 日会议上讨论的建议序言草案中，夏皮罗

表示，专家组已取得广泛的共识，认为“试图利用成人细胞核去克隆婴儿将是违背道德伦理

的”）。

[题目译文]

专家小组就下列说法没有达成一致意见的选项是。

[A] 把禁止联邦基金用于克隆人写进法律

[B] 人类DNA 的克隆不应该受到更多的控制

[C] 用私人资助来克隆人是犯罪行为

258

[D] 克隆人是违反道德观念的

65. NBAC will leave the issue of embryo research undiscussed because__

[A] embryo research is just a current development of cloning

[B] the health of the child is not the main concern of embryo research

[C] an embryo’ s life will not be endangered in embryo research

[D] the issue is explicitly stated and settled in the law

[答案] D

关于胚胎研究的问题，文章第四段最后一句谈到“Because current federal law already forbids

the use of federal funds to create embryos ( the earliest stage of human offspring before birth) for

research or to knowingly endanger an embryo’ s life, NBAC will remain silent on embryo

research”（因为现行的联邦法律已经禁止使用联邦基金克隆研究用的胚胎（即人类后代出

生前的最早阶段）或有意识地危及胚胎的生命，NBAC 在胚胎研究这一问题上保持沉默） ，

因此显然D 为正确答案。A 选项与该句意思相反，而B 和C 选项的表述都与题意无关。

[题目译文]

NBAC 之所以不讨论胚胎研究问题是因为。

[A] 胚胎研究只不过是克隆研究的新发展

[B] 孩子的健康问题不是胚胎研究关注的重点

[C] 胚胎的生命不会再胚胎研究中受到威胁

[D] 该问题在法律上已经有了明确的规定和解决办法

**1999**年**Passage 5**

Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it prepares than on the preparedness of

the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton supposedly discovered gravity

through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in many places for centuries and thousands of

people had seen them fall. But Newton for years had been curious about the cause of the orbital

motion of the moon and planets. What kept them in place? Why didn’t they fall out of the sky?

The fact that the apple fell down toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the question

he had been asking himself about those lager fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.

259

How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the tree?

Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind was

ready for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research. If you don’t

have unpredictable things, you don’t have research. Scientists tend to forget this when writing

their cut and dried reports for the technical journals, but history is filled with examples of it.

In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression that

they find the "scientific method" a substitute for imaginative thought. I’ve attended research

conferences where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the advisability of continuing a

certain experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at the graphs, and said "the data are still

inconclusive." "We know that," the men from the budget office have said, "but what do you think?

Is it worthwhile going on? What do you think we might expect?" The scientist has been shocked at

having even been asked to speculate.

What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the victim of his own writings.

He has put forward unquestioned claims so consistently that he not only believes them himself,

but has convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If experiments are

planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the science journals

indicate, then it is perfectly logical for management to expect research to produce results

measurable in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable for auditors to believe that scientists who

know exactly where they are going and how they will get there should not be distracted by the

necessity of keeping one eye on the cash register while the other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if

regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his

papers would appear to reflect , is management to be blamed for discriminating against the "odd

balls among researchers in favor of more conventional thinkers who "work well with the team. "

67. The author wants to prove with the example of Isaac Newton that __

[A] inquiring minds are more important than scientific experiments

[B] science advances when fruitful researches are conducted

[C] scientists seldom forget the essential nature of research

[D] unpredictability weighs less than prediction in scientific research

[答案] A

[解题思路]

关于牛顿的例子所要证明的论点在文章的开头第一句话“Science, in practice, depends far less

on the experiments it prepares than on the preparedness of the minds of the men who watch the

260

experiments”（ 在实践中，科学的进步依赖于做实验，但更依赖于实验的观察者有所准备

的头脑），这句话强调了科学最重要的是要看观察实验的人是否在思想上做好了准备，显然

A 是符合这个意思的正确答案，其中选项中的“inquiring minds”对应于原文的“the

preparedness of the minds”。

[题目译文]

作者用艾萨克·牛顿的例子表明。

[A] 爱动脑筋比科学实验更加重要

[B] 只有进行富有成由的研究科学才能进步

[C] 科学家很少忘记研究的重要本质

[D] 在科学研究中，不可预测性不如预测重要

68. The author asserts that scientists __

[A] shouldn’t replace "scientific method" with imaginative thought

[B] shouldn’t neglect to speculate on unpredictable things

[C] should write more concise reports for technical journals

[D]should be confident about their research findings

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应的内容在文章的第二段和第三段。文章第二段第四、五句话指出“His mind was ready

for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research”（他的头脑在随

时准备思考不可预测的事。不可预测性是科学研究不可或缺的一个重要特征），而第三段最

后一句话则进一步批评说“The scientist has been shocked at having even been asked to

speculate”（这位科学家感到很震惊，他没有想到人们会让他做出预测），因此作者认为研

究要想出成果，科学家必须大胆推测，并要接受那些无法预测的东西。B 选项符合上述的观

点。

[题目译文]

作者认为科学家。

[A] 不应该用创造性思维来代替“科学方法”

[B] 不应该忽视对于不可预测事物的推测

[C] 应该为技术杂志撰写更加简洁的报告

261

[D] 应该对他们的研究成果充满信心

69. It seems that some young scientists__

[A] have a keen interest in prediction

[B] often speculate on the future

[C] think highly of creative thinking

[D] stick to "scientific method"

[答案] D

[解题思路]

文章第三段开头指出“In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather

the impression that they find the "scientific method" a substitute for imaginative thought”（在和

一些科学家，特别是青年科学家交谈时，你可能会产生这样一种印象：他们认为用所谓的“科

学方法”可以代替创造性思维），后面的例子也进一步说明了他们不会推测，只是坚持用传

统的方法，因此D 选项符合题意。而其余三个选项的表述都与原文相反。

[题目译文]

看起来一些青年科学家们。

[A] 对预测有着浓厚的兴趣

[B] 经常对未来做出推测

[C] 对创造性思维非常重视

[D] 只执著于“科学方法”

**2000**年**Passage 1**

A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly handled, it

may become a driving force. When the United States entered just such a glowing period after the

end of the Second World War, it had a market eight ties larger than any competitor, giving its

industries unparalleled economies of scale. Its scientists were the world’s best, its workers the

most skilled. America and Americans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the Europeans and

Asians whose economies the war had destroyed.

It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other countries grew richer. Just as

inevitably, the retreat from predominance proved painful. By the mid-1980s Americans had found

262

themselves at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. Some huge American industries,

such as consumer electronics, had shrunk or vanished in the face of foreign competition. By 1987

there was only one American television maker left, Zenith.(Now there is none: Zenith was bought

by South Korea’s LG Electronics in July.)Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into the

domestic market America’s machine-tool industry was on the ropes. For a while it looked as

though the making of semiconductors, which America had which sat at the heart of the new

computer age, was going to be the next casualty.

All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking prosperity for granted. They

began to believe that their way of doing business was failing, and that their incomes would

therefore shortly begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after another into the

causes of America’s industrial decline. Their sometimes sensational findings were filled with

warnings about the growing competition from overseas.

How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on five years of solid

growth while Japan has been struggling. Few Americans attribute this solely to such obvious

causes as a devalued dollar or the turning of the business cycle. Self-doubt has yielded to blind

pride." American industry has changed its structure, has gone on a diet, has learnt to be more

quick-witted," according to Richard Cavanagh, executive dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of

Government," It makes me proud to be an American just to see how our businesses are improving

their productivity, says Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. And

William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School believes that people will look back on this

period as" a golden age of business management in the United States."

51. The U.S.achieved its predominance after World War Ⅱbecause_____.

[A] it had made painstaking efforts towards this goal

[B] its domestic market was eight times larger than before

[C] the war had destroyed the economies of most potential competitors

[D] the unparalleled size of its workforce had given an impetus to its economy

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应信息为第一段的最后一句话“America and Americans were prosperous beyond the

dreams of the Europeans and Asians whose economies the war had destroyed”（美国的繁荣是那

些经济遭到战争破坏的欧亚诸国做梦也无法达到的），可见美国取得主导地位在很大程度上

是由于二战摧毁了其潜在竞争对手的经济，因此C 选项为正确答案。A 选项中的painstaking

efforts 与第一段中的“effortless”意思相左，是错误选项。B 选项与原文不符，因为文章的

263

意思是美国的国内市场比起竞争对手大8 倍，不是比以前大8 倍。D 选项提到的劳动力因素

不是主要原因。

[题目译文]

二战后美国之所以取得了优势地位是因为。

[A] 该国为实现这一目标而付出了艰苦的努力

[B] 其国内市场是过去的八倍

[C] 战争摧毁了大部分潜在竞争对手的经济

[D] 该国无可比拟的劳动力大军对经济起到了推动作用

52. The loss of U.S. predominance in the world economy in the 1980s is manifested in the fact

that the American_____.

[A] TV industry had withdrawn to its domestic market

[B] semiconductor industry had been taken over by foreign enterprises

[C] machine-tool industry had collapsed after suicidal actions

[D] auto industry had lost part of its domestic market

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章的第二段。第五句及其括号中的内容说“By 1987 there was only one

American television maker left, Zenith.(Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South Korea’s

LG Electronics in July.)”（面对国外竞争，一些像消费电子产业之类的大型美国工业已经萎

缩或渐渐消失。到1987 年，美国只剩下Zenith 一家电视生产商。（现在一家也没有了：Zenith

于当年7 月被韩国LG 电器公司收购。）），这说明电视机产业即使在国内市场也几乎已经

消失了，因此A 选项正确。B 选项对应于该段最后一句“For a while it looked as though the

making of semiconductors, which America had which sat at the heart of the new computer age,

was going to be the next casualty”（在新计算机时代有着核心作用的半导体正是美国人发明

的，但是有一段时期这个产业也似乎面临崩溃），文中认为半导体工业被外国企业接管是一

种可能性，并没有选项表述地这么绝对，因此B 选项也错误。C 选项对应于该段倒数第二

句话“Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into the domestic market America’s

machine-tool industry was on the ropes”（外国制造的汽车和纺织品正大举涌入国内市场。美

国的机床工业也即将消失），选项认为该行业已经崩溃，不符合题意。D 选项对应于该段第

三句话“By the mid-1980s Americans had found themselves at a loss over their fading industrial

264

competitiveness”（到了20 世纪80 年代中期，面对其日益衰退的工业竞争力，美国人感到

不知所措），因此选项的表述是符合原文的。

[题目译文]

美国在20 世纪80 年的世界经济中失去了统治地位，这可以通过以下事实表现出

来。

[A] 其电视行业退回到了国内市场

[B] 半导体工业被外国企业接管

[C] 机床业在其自杀性行为后倒闭

[D] 汽车业失去了部分国内市场

**2000**年**Passage 2**

Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males born for every 100 females,

but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice

as many women as men. But the great universal of male mortality is being changed. Now, by

babies survive almost as well as girls do. This means that, for the first time, there will be an excess

of boys in those crucial years when they are searching for a mate. More important, another chance

for natural selection has been removed. Fifty years ago, the chance of a baby (particularly a boy

baby)surviving depended on its weight. A kilogram too light or too heavy meant almost certain

death. Today it makes almost no difference. Since much of the variation is due to genes one more

agent of evolution has gone.

There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but have fewer children. Few

people are as fertile as in the past. Except in some religious communities, very few women has 15

children. Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death, has become average. Most of us

have roughly the same number of offspring. Again, differences between people and the

opportunity for natural selection to take advantage of it have diminished. India shows what is

happening. The country offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty for the remaining

tribal peoples. The grand mediocrity of today everyone being the same in survival and number of

offspring means that natural selection has lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class India

compared to the tribes.

For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived. Strangely, it has

involved little physical change No other species fills so many places in nature. But in the past

100,000 years –even the past 100 years—our lives have been transformed but our bodies have not.

We did not evolve, because machines and society did it for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe

265

those ignorant of evolution: they "look at an organic being as average looks at a ship, as at

something wholly beyond his comprehension." No doubt we will remember a 20th century way of

life beyond comprehension for its ugliness. But however amazed our descendants may be at how

far from Utopia we were, they will look just like us.

55. What used to be the danger in being a man according to the first paragraph?

[A] A lack of mates.

[B] A fierce competition.

[C] A lower survival rate.

[D] A defective gene.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应信息在文章第一段，其中第一段前两句说道“Being a man has always been dangerous.

There are about 105 males born for every 100 females, but this ratio drops to near balance at the

age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice as many women as men”（做男人总是

充满危险，出生时男女比例大约是105:100，但到了成熟期，这一比例几乎持平，而在70

岁的老人中女性的人数是男性的两倍），说明男人存活下来的几率低于女人，因此C 为正

确答案。A 选项的问题是现在的一个问题，但题中“used to be”指过去的情况，因此A 选

项错误。B 和D 选项在原文中没有提及。

[题目译文]

根据文章第一段，在过去，作为男人的一个危险是什么？

[A] 缺乏配偶

[B] 激烈的竞争

[C] 存活率较低

[D] 缺损的基因

56. What does the example of India illustrate?

[A] Wealthy people tend to have fewer children than poor people.

[B] Natural selection hardly works among the rich and the poor.

[C] The middle class population is 80% smaller than that of the tribes.

266

[D] India is one of the countries with a very high birth rate.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

关于印度的例子出现在文章第二段的最后三句话“India shows what is happening. The country

offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty for the remaining tribal peoples. The grand

mediocrity of today everyone being the same in survival and number of offspring means that

natural selection has lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes”（印

度的现状可以说明正在发生的一切。这个国家给大城市里的少数人提供财富，而留给其余的

各部落民族都是贫困。今天这种极其显著的平均化——每个人的生存机会和子女数量都相同

——意味着与部落相比较，自然选择在印度中上层已经失去了80％的作用）。浏览几个选

项就可以发现B 选项对引文最后半句“natural selection has lost 80% of its power in uppermiddle-

class India compared to the tribes”的同义说明，因而是正确选项。A 选项的表述在原

文中没有对应信息，因而可以排除。C 选项对80%这个数据的使用与原文意思相反，且选项

中的middle class population 与原文中的upper-middle-class India 意思也有出入。D 选项没有

在原文中出现，可以排除。

[题__________目译文]

印度的例子说明了什么？

[A] 富人总是比穷人生孩子少。

[B] 自然选择在富人和穷人之间并不起作用。

[C] 中产阶级人口比布罗人口少了80%。

[D] 印度是出生率很高的国家之一。

57. The author argues that our bodies have stopped evolving because____ .

[A] life has been improved by technological advance

[B] the number of female babies has been declining

[C] our species has reached the highest stage of evolution

[D] the difference between wealth and poverty is disappearing

[答案] A

[解题思路]

267

从题干中的stopped evolving 我们可以定为到原文最后一段的第五句话“We did not evolve,

because machines and society did it for us”（我们没有进化，因为机器和社会替我们办了这一

切），其中machines and society 即与A 选项中的technological advance 向呼应，即科技极大

地提高了人们的生活质量，以至于我们的身体已经停止了进化。B 和D 选项都与这道题讨

论的evolution 话题无关，可轻松排除。C 选项的表述过于绝对，从最后一段的最后一句话

“But however amazed our descendants may be at how far from Utopia we were, they will look

just like us”（但是，不管我们的子孙后代对我们离乌托邦的理想境界之遥远感到有多么惊

讶，他们的长相将会跟我们差不了多少）可以看出是否停止进化尚无定论。

[题目译文]

作者认为我们的身体停止了进化的原因在于。

[A] 技术进步改进了我们的生活

[B] 女婴的数量一直在下降

[C] 我们这个物种已经达到了人类进化的最高阶段

[D] 贫富差距正在消失

**2000**年**Passage 3**

When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its

advocates are aiming at, for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles may seem

today, it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. With regard to Futurist

poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist poetry may be even admitting

that the theory on which it is based may be right, it can hardly be classed as Literature.

This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for a noise and violence and speed. Consequently, our

feelings, thoughts and emotions have undergone a corresponding change. This speeding up of life,

says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression. We must speed up our literature too, if we

want to interpret modern stress. We must pour out a large stream of essential words, unhampered

by stops, or qualifying adjectives, of finite verbs. Instead of describing sounds we must make up

words that imitate them; we must use many sizes of type and different colored inks on the same

page, and shorten or lengthen words at will.

Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little upsetting to read in the

explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on

a bridge off which they both fall into the river and then to find that the line consists of the noise of

their falling and the weights of the officers:’ Pluff! Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five kilograms.’

This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be classed as

268

Literature. All the same, no thinking man can refuse to accept their first proposition: that a great

change in our emotional life calls for a change of expression. The whole question is really this:

have we essentially changed?

60. When a novel literary idea appears, people should try to_____.

[A] determine its purposes

[B] ignore its flaws

[C] follow the new fashions

[D] accept the principles

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题需要准确理解题干的关键词之一“novel”，在这里不是“小说”的意思，而是一个形

容词，意为与new 相同。在确定了这一点之后可以对应到原文第一句话“When a new

movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its advocates are aiming

at”（当一场新的艺术运动形成某种时尚时，理应弄清其倡导者的目标所在），aming at 正

好对应于A 选项中的purposes，因而显然A 为正确选项。

[题目译文]

当一种新的文学思想出现的时候，人们应该试图。

[A] 弄清其目的

[B] 忽视其缺点

[C] 紧跟其潮流

[D] 接受其原则

61. Futurists claim that we must____.

[A] increase the production of literature

[B] use poetry to relieve modern stress

[C] develop new modes of expression

[D] avoid using adjectives and verbs

[答案] C

269

[解题思路]

关于未来派诗歌的一些创作主张出现在文章的第二段，其中第三句指出“This speeding up of

life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression”（未来派诗人声称，这种加速的生活

节奏需要一种新的表达形式），require a new form of expression 即C 选项中的new modes of

expression，form 和mode 是同义词，都是“形式”的意思。A 和B 选项都不是未来派诗歌

的主张，而D 选项的意思与该段第四句“We must speed up our literature too, if we want to

interpret modern stress”（如果我们想诠释现代生活的压力，就必须加快文学发展的步伐）

相反，因为并不是指放弃使用所有的形容词和动词。

[题目译文]

未来派诗人声称我们必须。

[A] 增加文学作品的产量

[B] 用诗歌来缓解现代压力

[C] 发展新的表达模式

[D] 避免使用形容词和动词

62. The author believes that Futurist poetry is_____.

[A] based on reasonable principles

[B] new and acceptable to ordinary people

[C] indicative of basic change in human nature

[D] more of a transient phenomenon than literature

[答案] D

[解题思路]

第一段最后一句指出“With regard to Futurist poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for

whatever Futurist poetry may be even admitting that the theory on which it is based may be right,

it can hardly be classed as Literature”（然而，就未来派诗歌而言，情况却相当不同，因为无

论未来派诗歌为什么——即使承认其理论根据可能正确——也很难称之为文学），同时最后

一段第一句也进一步强调“This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry,

can hardly be classed as Literature”（尽管这符合未来派诗歌的规则和要求，却很难被归入文

学之列），说明作者并不认为未来派诗歌可以算作文学，对其持否定态度，因此A 选项不

正确。B 选项也是错误的，因为文章中并为涉及普通人对于未来派诗歌的看法。C 选项对应

于原文最后一句话“The whole question is really this: have we essentially changed”（实际问题

270

是：我们真的发生了根本上的变化吗），但原文只是指出了一个疑问，并无定论，因而C

选项也是错误的。D 选项则符合作者的观点，未来派诗歌只会昙花一现，不会立足于文学界。

[题目译文]

作者认为未来派诗歌是。

[A] 给予合理的原则

[B] 对于普通百姓来说是新颖和易于接受的

[C] 暗示者人性的基本变化

[D] 与其说是文学，不如说是一种短暂现象

Passage 4

Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social

harmony are the envy of the United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are seeing a

decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were hardworking and

saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic

needs, and young people don’t know where they should go next.

The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated

job market have limited the opportunities of teen-agers who are already questioning the heavy

personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan’s rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs. In a

recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese students were fully satisfied with

school life, compared with 67.2 percent of students in the United States. In addition, far more

Japanese workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs than did their counterparts in the 10

other countries surveyed.

While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to

stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression." Those things that

do not show up in the test scores personality, ability, courage or humanity are completely

ignored," says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s education

committee." Frustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild." Last year

Japan experienced2,125 incidents of school violence, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the

outcry, many conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis on moral education.

Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued

that liberal reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World WarⅡhad

weakened the "Japanese morality of respect for parents."

But that may have more to do with Japanese life-stvles." In Japan," says educator Yoko Muro,

271

"it’s never a question of whether you enjoy your job and your life, but only how much you can

endure." With economic growth has come centralization; fully 76 percent of Japan’s 119 million

citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have been abandoned in favor of

isolated, two generation households. Urban Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes

(travels to and from work)and crowded living conditions, but as the old group and family values

weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the Japanese divorce rate, while

still well below that of the United States, has increased by more than 50 percent, and suicides have

increased by nearly one-quarter.

63. In the Westerner’s eyes, the postwar Japan was_____ .

[A] under aimless development

[B] a positive example

[C] a rival to the West

[D] on the decline

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章第一段第一句话“Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar

Japan whose productivity and social harmony are the envy of the United States and Europe”（战

后日本的生产率和社会的和谐为美国和欧洲所称羡，因此很难说迷茫是战后日本的特征），

同时第三段的第一句话“While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics”（虽

然日本的教育因强调基础知识而经常受到外国人的赞扬）也是西方人对战后日本的正面评

价，因此B 选项为正确答案。A、C、D 选项的意思都与原文相反，可以很容易排除。

[题目译文]

在西方人的眼里，战后的日本是。

[A] 处于盲目的发展中

[B] 一个积极的例子

[C] 西方的一个对手

[D] 处于衰落状态

64. According to the author, what may chiefly be responsible for the moral decline of Japanese

society?

272

[A] Women’s participation in social activities is limited.

[B] More workers are dissatisfied with their jobs.

[C] Excessive emphasis his been placed on the basics.

[D] The life-style has been influenced by Western values.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题需要将选项与原文作一一比较。A 选项关于妇女就业的问题对应于第二段的第一句“The

coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job

market have limited the opportunities of teen-agers who are already questioning the heavy

personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan’s rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs”（战

后生育高峰期的到来及妇女进入男性主宰的就业市场，这些都限制了青少年的发展机遇，这

些青少年已经开始质疑在进好学校学习，找好工作，攀登日本等级森严的社会阶梯的过程中

所做出的沉重的个人牺牲是否值得），可见A 选项不仅本身表述不符合原文，而且也与题

干的moral decline 无关。B 选项对应于第二段的最后一句话“In addition, far more Japanese

workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs than did their counterparts in the 10 other

countries surveyed”（此外，与被调查的其他10 个国家的工人相比，对自身工作表示不满的

日本工人要多得多），其表面意思是正确的，但却同样与moroal decline 无关。C 选项对应

于文章第三段第一句话“While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics,

Japanese education tends to stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and selfexpression”（

虽然日本的教育因强调基础知识而经常受到外国人的赞扬，但是它往往强调

考试和机械学习而忽视了创造性和自我表现），但选项中excessive 一词在原文中并没有体

现，且没有直接提到这种教育对于道德下降的影响。D 选型对应于第三段最后一句话“Last

year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that

liberal reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World WarⅡhad

weakened the "Japanese morality of respect for parents."”（去年，时任教育大臣的Mitsuo

Setoyama 就提出责难，他认为二战后美国占领当局引进的自由改革削弱了“日本人尊敬父

母的道德观”）和第四段第一句话“But that may have more to do with Japanese life-stvles”（但

是，那也许与日本人的生活方式关系更大），可见最大的因素是日本人生活方式的西化导致

了道德水准的下滑。

[题目译文]

作者认为日本社会的道德败坏主要是由于什么原因？

[A] 妇女对社会活动的参与受到了限制。

273

[B] 更多的工人对他们的工作不满意。

[C] 过分重视打基础。

[D] 生活方式受到了西方价值观的影响。

65. Which of the following is true according to the author?

[A] Japanese education is praised for helping the young climb the social ladder

[B] Japanese education is characterized by mechanical learning as well as creativity.

[C] More stress should be placed on the cultivation of creativity.

[D] Dropping out leads to frustration against test taking.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题应把各选项与原文一一对应。A 选项对应于第二段的第一句话“The coming of age of the

postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job market have limited the

opportunities of teen-agers who are already questioning the heavy personal sacrifices involved in

climbing Japan’s rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs”（战后生育高峰期的到来及妇女

进入男性主宰的就业市场，这些都限制了青少年的发展机遇，这些青少年已经开始质疑在进

好学校学习，找好工作，攀登日本等级森严的社会阶梯的过程中所做出的沉重的个人牺牲是

否值得），但选项表述却与原文相反。B 选型的说法与第三段的第一句话“While often praised

by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to stress test taking and

mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression”（虽然日本的教育因强调基础知识而

经常受到外国人的赞扬，但是它往往强调考试和机械学习而忽视了创造性和自我表现）矛盾，

因为日本教育的特点不是强调创造力。D 选项对应于第三段第三句话“Frustration against this

kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild”（由此产生的受挫感致使孩子辍学、放荡不

羁），而选项正好颠倒了因果关系。C 选项对应于第三段第一句话，这说明作者认为在培养

创造力方面需要下更大的功夫，因此C 是正确选项。

[题目译文]

下列哪一项符合作者的意思？

[A] 日本教育应为帮助年轻人爬上社会阶梯而受到了赞赏。

[B] 日本教育的特色包括机械学习和创造力。

[C] 应该更加强调创造能力的培养。

[D] 中途退学导致对于考试的挫败感。

66. The change in Japanese life-style is revealed in the fact that____ .

[A] the young are less tolerant of discomforts in the fact that_____ .

[B] the divorce rate in Japan exceeds that in the U.S.

[C] the Japanese endure more than ever before

[D] the Japanese appreciate their present life

[答案] A

[解题思路]

关于life-style 的表述主要集中在文章的最后一段。通过最后两句话“Urban Japanese have long

endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work)and crowded living conditions, but as the

old group and family values weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the

Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that of the United States, has increased by more than

[题目译文]

日本人生活方式的改变可以通过以下哪项事实反映出来？

[A] 年轻人对于生活中的不便更难忍受

[B] 日本的离婚率超过了美国

[C] 日本人要忍受比以前更多的东西

[D] 日本人更加欣赏现在的生活

**2000**年**Passage 5**

If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition health, distinction, control over one’s

destiny must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition’s behalf. If the tradition of

ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it especially must be highly regarded by

people who are themselves admired, the educated not least among them. In an odd way, However,

it is the educated who have claimed to have give up on have give up on ambition as an ideal. What

275

is odd is that they have perhaps most benefited from ambition-if not always their own the that of

their parents and grandparents. There is heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn

door after the horses have escaped with the educated themselves riding on them.

Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly.

Summer homes, European travel, BMWs. The locations, place names and name brands may

change, but such items do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago. What

has happened is that people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily and openly as once they

could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and vulgar. Instead, we are treated to fine

hypocritical spectacles, which now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic of American

materialism with a Southampton summer home; the publisher of radical books who takes his

meals in three-star restaurants; the journalist advocating participatory democracy in all phases of

life, whose own children are enrolled in private schools. For such people and many more perhaps

not so exceptional, the proper formulation is," Succeed at all costs but avoid appearing ambitious."

The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; its public defenders are few

and unimpressive, where they are not extremely unattractive. As a result, the support for ambition

as a healthy impulse, a quality to be admired and fixed in the mind of the young, is probably lower

than it has ever been in the United States. This does not mean that ambition is at an end, that

people no longer feel its stirrings and promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is

less openly underground, or made sly. Such, then, is the way things stand: on the left angry critics,

on the right stupid supporters, and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to

get on in life.

67. It is generally believed that ambition may be well regarded if _____.

[A] its returns well compensate for the sacrifices

[B] it is rewarded with money, fame and power

[C] its goals are spiritual rather than material

[D] it is shared by the rich and the famous

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章的第一句话“If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition

health, distinction, control over one’s destiny must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on

ambition’s behalf”（个人的雄心如果能被正确看待的话，那么它的回报——财富、声誉、对

命运的掌握——则应该被认为是值得为之付出的牺牲），其中A 选项returns 对应原文的

276

rewards，well compensate of sacrifice 对应于well worthy of，因而A 为正确选项。B 选项体

现了这句话前半句的意思，却没有抓住全句重点，因而是错误选项。C 和D 选项则与原文

对应信息无关。

[题目译文]

人们普遍认为拥有抱负是一件好事，如果。

[A] 其回报很好地补偿了付出

[B] 可以得到金钱、名誉和权力等的回报

[C] 其目标是精神的，而不是物质的

[D] 富人和名人分享共同的抱负

69. Some people do not openly admit they have ambition because____ .

[A] they think of it as immoral

[B] their pursuits are not fame or wealth

[C] ambition is not closely related to material benefits

[D] they do not want to appear greedy and contemptible

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章的第二段第三句话“What has happened is that people cannot confess fully to

their dreams, as easily and openly as once they could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and

vulgar.”（现在的情况是人们不能像以前那样轻易地、公开地坦陈自己的梦想，惟恐别人认

为自己爱出风头、贪婪、庸俗），其中D 选项的greedy and comtemptible 对应于原文的aquisitive

and vulgar，因此D 是正确选项。

[题目译文]

一些人不公开承认他们有抱负是因为。

[A] 他们认为这样做是不道德的

[B] 他们追求的东西并不是名利

[C] 抱负与物质利益之间没有必然联系

[D] 他们不想显得贪婪和可鄙

**2001**年**Passage 1**

Specialisation can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of

scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units, one man could continue

to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But specialisation was only

one of a series of related developments in science affecting the process of communication.

Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific activity.

No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science:

exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word 'amateur' does carry a connotation that

the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific community and, in particular, may

not fully share its values. The growth of specialisation in the nineteenth century, with its

consequent requirement of a longer, more complex training, implied greater problems for amateur

participation in science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based

especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the

development of geology in the United Kingdom.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not

simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what

constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local geological studies

represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth century, local studies

have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the

wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have continued to pursue local studies in

the old way. The overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals

harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing,

first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological journals in

the twentieth century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals have now

appeared aimed mainly towards either professiona

l or amateur readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to professional

geologists coming together nationally within one or two specific societies, whereas the amateurs

have tended either to remain in local societies or to come together nationally in a different way.

Although the process of professionalisation and specialisation was already well under way in

British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed until the

twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned as the

crucial period for this change in the structure of science.

51. The growth of specialisation in the 19th century might be more clearly seen in sciences such as

________.

278

[A] sociology and chemistry

[B] physics and psychology

[C] sociology and psychology

[D] physics and chemistry

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章第二段最后一句话的前半句“The trend was naturally most obvious in

those areas of science based especially on a mathematical or laboratory training”（这种趋势特别

是在以数学和实验室训练为基础的科学领内自然表现得尤为明显），可见题目指的那些学科

主要指以数学和试验训练为基础的自然科学，而不包括社会科学。选项中由于sociology 和

psychology 都属于社会科学范畴，因而可以排除A、B、C 选项，D 为正确答案。

[题目译文]

19 世纪专业化的发展得到更明显表现的学科有。

[A] 社会学和化学

[B] 物理学和心理学

[C] 社会学和心理学

[D] 物理学和化学

54. The direct reason for specialisation is ________.

[A] the development in communication

[B] the growth of professionalisation

[C] the expansion of scientific knowledge

[D] the splitting up of academic societies

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应信息为文章第一段的第一句话“Specialisation can be seen as a response to the

problem of an increasing accumulation of scientific knowledge”（专业分工可以看作是针对科

学知识不断膨胀这一问题所做出的反应），因此答案为C 显而易见，其中选项中的expansion

对应于原文的accumulation，都说明了科学知识的增加导致了specialization。

279

[题目译文]

专业化的直接理由是。

[A] 沟通的发展

[B] 职业化的发展

[C] 科学知识的扩张

[D] 学术团体的分裂

**2001**年**Passage 2**

A great deal of attention is being paid today to the so called digital divide-the division of the

world into the info（information）rich and the info poor. And that divide does exist today. My wife

and I lectured about this looming danger twenty years ago. What was less visible then, however,

were the new, positive forces that work against the digital divide. There are reasons to be

optimistic.

There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow. As the Internet becomes

more and more commercialized, it is in the interest of business to universalize access-after all, the

more people online, the more potential customers there are. More and more governments, afraid

their countries will be left behind, want to spread Internet access. Within the next decade or two,

one to two billion people on the planet will be netted together. As a result, I now believe the

digital divide will narrow rather than widen in the years ahead. And that is very good news

because the Internet may well be the most powerful tool for combating world poverty that we've

ever had.

Of course, the use of the Internet isn't the only way to defeat poverty. And the Internet is not the

only tool we have. But it has enormous potential.

To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to get over their outdated

anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign investment. Countries that still think foreign

investment is an invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history of infrastructure （the

basic structural foundations of a society）in the United States. When the United States built its

industrial infrastructure, it didn't have the capital to do so. And that is why America's Second

Wave infrastructure-including roads, harbors, highways, ports and so on-were built with foreign

investment. The English, the Germans, the Dutch and the French were investing in Britain's

former colony. They financed them. Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who owns them now?

The Americans believe the same thing would be true in places like Brazil or anywhere else for

that matter. The more foreign capital you have helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure,

280

which today is an electronic infrastructure, the better off you're going to be. That doesn't mean

lying down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign corporations run uncontrolled. But it does

mean recognizing how important they can be in building the energy and telecom infrastructures

needed to take full advantage of the Internet.

55．Digital divide is something _________.

[A]getting worse because of the Internet

[B]the rich countries are responsible for

[C]the world must guard against

[D]considered positive today

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应信息在文章的第一段，其中第二句指出，“My wife and I lectured about this looming

danger twenty years ago”（我和我妻子20 年前就曾谈及这个隐约显现的危险），因而C 选

access-after all, the more people online, the more potential customers there are”（随着互联网的

日趋商业化，上网普及符合商家的利益——毕竟，上网人数越多，潜在的客户就越多），紧

接着在第三句话中指出“More and more governments, afraid their countries will be left behind,

want to spread Internet access”（现在越来越多的政府惟恐自己的国家落后，纷纷推广互联网

的使用范围），可见各国政府也不愿错过互联网蕴含的巨大经济利益的潜力，正确答案相应

to be”（你拥有越多的外国资金去建造第三次浪潮基础设施（今天主要指电子基础设施），

那么你的情况就会越好），“electronic infrastructure”说明了当代社会经济发展的重点在电

子产业，正确答案为A 选项。B 选项属于无中生有，可以排除。C 选项有一定干扰性，但

文中用美国工业基础设施建设这个例子的目的在于说明应该利用外国投资，而不是要各国盲

**2001**年**Passage 3**

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? The American Society

of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this painful question. The organization is deepsintosa

long self-analysis known as the journalism credibility project.

Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors and

spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement about what in

the world those readers really want.

But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through a set

of standard templates (patterns)sintoswhich they plug each day's events. In other words, there is a

conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-made

narrative structure for otherwise confusing news.

There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which helps

explain why the "standard templates" of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a recent

survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around the country, plus

one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned at random and

asked the same questions.

Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale

neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, and trade stocks, and they're less likely to go to

church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community.

Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work tends to

reflect the conventional values of this elite. The astonishing distrust of the news media isn't rooted

in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between reporters and

their readers.

283

This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a troubled

business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. Then it sponsors

lots of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why customers are annoyed

and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to noticing the cultural and class

biases that so many former buyers are complaining about. If it did, it would open up its diversity

program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by

outlook, values, education, and class.

60. The results of the journalism credibility project turned out to be .

[A] quite trustworthy

[B] somewhat contradictory

[C] very illuminating

[D] rather superficial

[答案] D

The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed. The

process sweeps from hyperactive America to Europe and reaches the emerging countries with

unsurpassed might. Many in these countries are looking at this process and worrying: Won't the

wave of business concentration turn into an uncontrollable anti-competitive force?

There's no question that the big are getting bigger and more powerful. Multinational

corporations accounted for less than 20% of international trade in 1982. Today the figure is more

than 25% and growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing segment of

production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment. In Argentina, for instance,

after the reforms of the early 1990s, multinationals went from 43% to almost 70% of the industrial

production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon has created serious concerns over the role

of smaller economic firms, of national businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world

economy.

I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that

underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower trade and

investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable of meeting

customers' demands. All these are beneficial, not detrimental, to consumers. As productivity

grows, the world's wealth increases.

Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty. Yet it is hard to

imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to competition

that were feared nearly a century ago in the US, when the Standard Oil trust was broken up. The

mergers of telecom companies, such as World Com, hardly seem to bring higher prices for

consumers or a reduction in the pace of technical progress. On the contrary, the price of

communications is coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing—witness Daimler

286

and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan—but it does not appear that consumers are being hurt.

Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few weeks ago, Alan

Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking industry. Who is going to supervise,

regulate and operate as lender of last resort with the gigantic banks that are being created? Won't

multinationals shift production from one place to another when a nation gets too strict about

infringements to fair competition? And should one country take upon itself the role of defending

competition on issues that affect many other nations, as in the US vs. Microsoft case?

63. What is the typical trend of businesses today?

[A] To take in more foreign funds.

[B] To invest more abroad.

[C] To combine and become bigger.

[D] To trade with more countries.

[答案] C

**2001**年**Passage 5**

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might become a

part of a new international trend. A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my professional

progress prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of a

disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming "I wanted to spend more time with

my family".

Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and two novels later, my experiment in what the

Americans term "downshifting" has turned my tired excuse into an absolute reality. I have been

transformed from a passionate advocate of the philosophy of "having it all", preached by Linda

Kelsey for the past seven years in the page of She magazine, into a woman who is happy to settle

for a bit of everything.

288

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the

editorship of She after a build up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of "juggling your life",

and making the alternative move into "downshifting" brings with it far greater rewards than

financial success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to return to the kind of life Kelsey

used to advocate and I once enjoyed: 12 hour working days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain

of office politics and the limitations of being a parent on "quality time".

In America, the move away from juggling to a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle is a wellestablished

trend. Downshifting-also known in America as "voluntary simplicity"-has, ironically,

even bred a new area of what might be termed anti-consumerism. There are a number of bestselling

downshifting self-help books for people who want to simplify their lives; there are

newsletters, such as The Tightwad Gazette, that give hundreds of thousands of Americans useful

tips on anything from recycling their cling-film to making their own soap; there are even support

groups for those who want to achieve the mid-'90s equivalent of dropping out.

While in America the trend started as a reaction to the economy decline-after the mass

redundancies caused by downsizing in the late'80s-and is still linked to the politics of thrift, in

Britain, at least among the middle-class down-shifters of my acquaintance, we have different

reasons for seeking to simplify our lives.

For the women of my generation who were urged to keep juggling through the'80s,downshifting

in the mid-'90s is not so much a search for the mythical good life-growing your own organic

vegetables, and risking turning into one-as a personal recognition of your limitations.

67．Which of the following is true according to paragraph 1?

[A] Full-time employment is a new international trend.

[B] The writer was compelled by circumstances to leave her job.

[C] "A lateral move" means stepping out of full-time employment.

[D] The writer was only too eager to spend more time with her family.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可以将选项的说法语原文进行一一比较。A 选项对应于文章的文章第一句话“When I

decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might become a part of a

new international trend”（当决定辞去自己的全职工作时，我决没有想到自己会成为国际新

潮流的一分子），可见A 选项的意思正好与原文相反，即放慢生活节奏、而非全职工作才

是国际潮流。C 选项“a lateral move”是作者“stepping out of full-tine employment”的原因，

289

选项将二者等同起来是错误的。D 选项对应于第一段最后一句话“in the manner of a disgraced

government minister, I covered my exit by claiming "I wanted to spend more time with my

family"”（当然，就像面子扫尽的政府部长那样，我也掩饰说“我只想与家人更多的呆在一

起”），说明这只是作者辞职的托词，并不是真心实意，因此D 选项也是错误的。B 选项

对应于该段第二句“A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my professional progress

prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although”（一次平级的人事调动伤了

我的自尊心，并且阻碍了我的事业发展，这促使我放弃原来那个地位较高的职业），可见辞

职是由于工作环境所迫，因此正确答案为B。

[题目译文]

下面哪一项符合文章第一段的意思？

[A] 全职工作是一种新的国际潮流。

[B] 作者由于环境所迫而离职。

[C] “横向调动”意味着要离开全职工作

[D] 作者只是想花耕读哦的时间陪伴她的家人

68．The writer's experiment shows that downshifting _________.

[A] enables her to realize her dream

[B] helps her mold a new philosophy of life

[C] prompts her to abandon her high social status

[D] leads her to accept the doctrine of [WTBX]she magazine

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应信息在文章第二段第二句“I have been transformed from a passionate advocate of the

philosophy of "having it all", preached by Linda Kelsey for the past seven years in the page of She

magazine, into a woman who is happy to settle for a bit of everything”（我已从一个“获得一切”

哲学（琳达·凯茜过去七年中在《她》这本杂志所宣扬的）的狂热支持者，变成了一个对一

切浅尝辄止就心满意足的女人），也就是放慢生活节奏后她形成了新的生活哲学，因此B

选项符合题意。A 选项的错误在于downshifting 原本不是作者的梦想。C 选项的内容与

downshifting 无关。而D 选项的表述正好与原文相反。

[题目译文]

290

作者的实验表明“放慢生活节奏” 。

[A] 使她实现了梦想

[B] 帮她形成了一种新的生活哲学

[C] 促使她放弃了很高的社会地位

[D] 使她接受了《她》杂志的教条

70．According to the passage, downshifting emerged in the U.S. as a result of _________.

[A]the quick pace of modern life

[B]man's adventurous spirit

[C]man's search for mythical experiences

[D]the economic situation

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify

shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to

show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy

with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different.

291

If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their

secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their

disorganized bosses.

Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ convention, of a story which works well because

the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown

around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so

on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival

is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his

food and stomps over to a table by himself. “Who is that?" the new arrival asked St. Peter. “On,

that’s God," came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks he’s a doctor."

If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the

experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to make

a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties.

With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider

making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if

you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system.

If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural.

Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and

unforced manner. Often it’s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and

remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a

light-hearted remark.

Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote “If at first

you don’t succeed, give up" or a play on words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration and

understatements. Look at your talk and pickout a few words or sentences which you can turn

about and inject with humor.

41. To make your humor work, you should .

[A] take advantage of different kinds of audience.

[B] make fun of the disorganized people.

[C] address different problems to different people.

[D] show sympathy for your listeners.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

292

本题对应信息在第一段第三句话“Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be

different（” 根据与你谈话对象的不同，问题也应有所不同），因此正确答案为C。要注意address

这个词在原文和选项中的用法是不同的：原文中address s[B]意思是“对某人讲话”，而选项

中address problems 是“处理问题”的意思。A 选项中的“take advantage of”的意思是“利用”，

与原文意思相左。B 选项的“make fun of”与原文第一段中第四句话的refer to, comment on 意

思不同，原文并没有取消的意思。而D 选项中的show sympathy of（同情）与原文中的be in

sympathy with（赞同、支持）的意思也不同，因此这三项都可以排除。

[题目译文]

[C] 对不同的人谈论不同的问题

[D] 对听者表示同情

确选项。A 和D 选项都是对故事牵强附会的理解，而C 选项则属于无中生有。

[题目译文]

关于医生的这则笑话说明了，在护士的眼中，医生们。

[A] 对新来者不礼貌

[B] 清楚地意识到自己的角色像上帝

[C] 被赋予某些特权

44. To achieve the desired result, humorous stories should be delivered.

[A] in well-worded language.

[B] as awkwardly as possible.

[C] in exaggerated statements.

[D] as casually as possible.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

文章的第四段第二句话中提到“Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks”（你可

以用轻松的、不做作的方式说一些很随便的、看上去是即兴的话），也就是说，要达到幽默

的最好效果，风格一定要随意和自然，不要做作，因此D 选项符合文章的意思。A、B 选项

显然与原文的意思相反，可以排除。至于C 选项，尽管文章最后一段提到了exaggeration，

但是原文的意思是幽默的内容可以是一些夸张的说法，但不是只表达幽默的风格。

[题目译文]

要想取得预期的效果，讲幽默故事的时候应该。

[A] 用精心组织的语言

[B] 尽可能显得蹩脚

[C] 用夸张的语言

[D] 尽量显得随意

**2002**年**Text 2**

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope with

work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has resulted in

robotics—the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And if scientists have

yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.

As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence

we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our factories

hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that

294

thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by

tireless robo-drivers. And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micromechanics,

there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery

with submillimeter accuracy—far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve

with their hands alone.

But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less

human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves—goals that pose a

real challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific error," says Dave Lavery,

manager of a robotics program at NASA, “we can’t yet give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to

reliably interact with a dynamic world."

Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite a spell

of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and

microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers

lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.

What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one

hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented—and human perception far more

complicated—than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error of a

machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the human

mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is

irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the

single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer systems on Earth can’t

approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it.

46. Human ingenuity was initially demonstrated in .

[A] the use of machines to produce science fiction.

[B] the wide use of machines in manufacturing industry.

[C] the invention of tools for difficult and dangerous work.

[D] the elite’s cunning tackling of dangerous and boring work.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本文的对应信息为文章的第一句话“Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised

ever more cunning tools to cope with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain

nasty”（从人类萌发了创造力，他们就一直在设计各种日益精巧的工具来处理那些危险、

295

枯燥、繁重或者只是令人讨厌的工作），四个选项中只有C 选项符合这句话的意思，答案

非常容易定位。

[题目译文]

人类的创造力最早表现在。

[A] 用机器生产科幻小说

[B] 在制造业中广泛使用机器

[C] 为应付困难且危险的工作而设计出各种工具

[D] 精英们对于危险且乏味工作的巧妙处理

[A] fulfill delicate tasks like performing brain surgery.

[B] interact with human beings verbally.

[C] have a little common sense.

[D] respond independently to a changing world.

[解题思路]

本题可以与原文进行一一对应。首先，文章第二段最后一句话指出“there are already robot

systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy—far

greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone”（已有一些机

器人系统能够进行精确到亚毫米的脑部和骨髓手术），A 选项的表述与这句话的意思相反，

因此是错误答案。B 选项在文中没有提及，根据常识判断也是一个错误选项。同时，第三段

的最后一句话指出“we can’t yet give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to reliably interact with a

dynamic world”（我们仍然不能赋予机器人以足够的‘常识’，使它们能够与不断变化的动

态世界进行可靠的交流），因此，C 选项不正确。D 选项之所以正确来可以从这句话中判断，

机器人无法对外界变化做出可靠的反应，但是却是可以独立作出反应的。

[题目译文]

根据本文，人类现在还没有能力做到的是设计出一种机器人能够。

[A] 完成像脑外科手术那样的艰巨任务

[B] 与人类进行语言交流

[C] 有一些常识

296

[D] 能对变化的世界作出独立的反应

49. Besides reducing human labor, robots can also .

[A] make a few decisions for themselves.

[B] deal with some errors with human intervention.

[C] improve factory environments.

[D] cultivate human creativity.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

文章第三段第一句话说“But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will

have to operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for

themselves”（但是如果机器人要进入帮助人们节省劳力的下一个阶段，它们的运行就应该

在更大程度上无需受人监控，并且至少能够独立地做一些决定）。由于这是一个假设的条件，

倒推过来就是说现在机器人还不能自己做决定，还需要受人们的控制，因此A 选项错误，B

选项正确。文章最后一段提到了“a controlled factory environment”，但也不是C 选项中

“improve”的意思。而D 选项在原文并没有涉及。

[题目译文]

除了减少人类劳动，机器人还能够。

[A] 为自己做一些决定

[B] 在人类的干预下应付一些问题

[C] 改善工厂环境

[D] 培养人类的创造力

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since OPEC agreed to supplycuts

in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last

December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when

prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in

double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom

and doom this time?

297

The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports.

Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could

push the price higher still in the short term.

Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than in

the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of

petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price, so

even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on pump prices than in the

past.

Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in

the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy,

energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile

telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices)

rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest

Economic Outlook that, it oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in

1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is

less than one-quarter of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing

emerging economies—to which heavy industry has shifted—have become more energy-intensive,

and so could be more seriously squeezed.

One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s,

it has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess

demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic decline. The

Economist’s commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year ago. In 1973 commodity

prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.

51. The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is

[A] global inflation.

[B] reduction in supply.

[C] fast growth in economy.

[D] Iraq’s suspension of exports.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可以采用排除法。首先，C、D 选项都出现在第二段，是上一次石油价格上涨的因素，

与这一次的无关。原文第一段的倒数第二句话指出“Both previous shocks resulted in double2011

digit inflation and global economic decline”（前两次的油价暴涨都导致了两位数的通货膨胀

指出“Since OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost

$26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last December”（自从石油输出国组织欧佩克在3 月决定减

少原油供应，原油的价格便从去年12 月的每桶不到10 美元攀升到约每桶26 美元），可见

真正的原因在于石油供应的减少，因而B 选项正确。

最近石油价格上涨的一个主要原因是。

[A] 全球性的通货膨胀

[B] 供应的减少

[C] 经济的迅速发展

[D] 伊拉克停止石油出口

53. The estimates in Economic Outlook show that in rich countries

[A] heavy industry becomes more energy-intensive.

[B] income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices.

[C] manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed.

[D] oil price changes have no significant impact on GDP.

[答案] D

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications for

how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.

Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in

effect supported the medical principle of “double effect," a centuries-old moral principle holding

that an action having two effects—a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is

foreseen—is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to

control terminally ill patients’ pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the

patient.

Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield

doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients

sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death."

George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long

as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal

even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. “It’s like surgery," he says. “We don’t call those

deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their

death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their

suicide."

On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate

has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the

physical agony of dying.

Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy

of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End

of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced

medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying" as the twin problems

of end-of-life care.

The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospitals, to test knowledge of

aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care,

and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.

300

Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical initiatives

translate into better care. “Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their

patients are needlessly and predictably suffering," to the extent that it constitutes “systematic

patient abuse." He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear…that painful deaths are

presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should result in license suspension."

57. Which of the following statements its true according to the text?

[A] Doctors will be held guilty if they risk their patients’ death.

[B] Modern medicine has assisted terminally ill patients in painless recovery.

[C] The Court ruled that high-dosage pain-relieving medication can be prescribed.

[D] A doctor’s medication is no longer justified by his intentions.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题可以采用排除法。文章第五段的最后一句指出“If you’re a physician, you can risk your

patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their suicide”（假如你是一名医生，只要你并没有

想让病人自杀，你就可以去冒险给比病人治病），A 选项的意思正好与原文相反。第六段中

提到“many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been

fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical

agony of dying”（许多医疗界人士承认，致使医助自杀这场争论升温的部分原因是由于病人

们的绝望情绪而引起的，对这些病人来说，现代医学延长了临终前肉体上的痛苦），B 选项

的表述也与原文相反。同时，第五段第一句中指出“as long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a

legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to

hasten death”（只要医生是出于合理的医疗目的开药，那么即使服用此药会加速病人的死亡，

医生的行为也没有违法），因此医生开药是可以根据合理动机的，D 选项错误。那么C 选

项就是正确答案，它虽然在文中没有直接的表述，但是文章第二段通过“Although it ruled that

there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the

medical principle of “double effect,"”（尽管裁决认为，宪法没有赋予医生帮助病人自杀的权

利，然而最高法庭实际上却认可了医疗界的“双重效应”原则）暗示了这一点，紧接着第三

段中“Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to

control terminally ill patients’ pain”（医生们一直在用这项原则，为自己替病危患者注射大剂

量的吗啡镇痛的做法提供正当的理由）进而证明了这一点。

[题目译文]

301

下面的哪一项符合文意？

[A] 医生如果那病人的生命来冒险将被认为有罪。

[B] 现代医学帮助晚期病人得到无痛康复。

[C] 最高法院裁定开大剂量能够减轻痛苦的药。

[D] 医生开的药不再由其动机决定。

58. According to the NAS’s report, one of the problems in end-of-life care is .

[A] prolonged medical procedures.

[B] inadequate treatment of pain.

[C] systematic drug abuse.

[D] insufficient hospital care.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

NAS 的报告出现在文章的第七段，该段最后一句话说“It identifies the undertreatment of pain

and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even

dishonor the period of dying" as the twin problems of end-of-life care”（报告指出了医院临终关

怀护理中存在的两个问题：对减轻病痛处理不力和大胆使用“无效而强制性的医疗程序，这

些程序可能会延长死亡期，甚至会让死亡期难堪”），因此其中一个问题是对病痛的处理不

力，答案显然为B。其他三项内容都与该报告无关。

[题目译文]

根据国家科学院的报告，临终关怀的问题之一在于。

[A] 延长了治疗程序

[B] 对痛苦的处理不充分

[C] 系统性的药物滥用

[D] 医院的照料不够

60. George Annas would probably agree that doctors should be punished if they .

[A] manage their patients incompetently.

[B] give patients more medicine than needed.

302

[C] reduce drug dosages for their patients.

[D] prolong the needless suffering of the patients.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

安纳斯关于文章最后一段的讨论出现在文章最后一段，““Large numbers of physicians seem

unconcerned with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering," to the extent

that it constitutes “systematic patient abuse." He says medical licensing boards “must make it

clear…that painful deaths are presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should

result in license suspension."”（“不少医生对病人所遭受的毫无必要且可预见的痛苦无动于

衷”，乃至于已构成“蓄意虐待病人”。他说，行医资格理事会“必须明确……令人痛苦的

死亡可以认定是治疗不当造成的后果，应该吊销行医执照”），B、C 选项显然与原文内容

不符，因此可以排除。A 选项具有一定的迷惑性，但是manage patients incompletely 是painful

deaths 的原因，而painful deaths 才是license suspension 的原因，因此D 才是正确选项。

[题目译文]

乔治·安纳斯可能认为医生应该受到处罚，如果他们。

[A] 照顾病人并不尽力

[B] 为病人提供不必要的药物

[C] 为病人较少用药量

[D] 延长病人不必要的痛苦

Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster who built the

Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated

with information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the "great game" of

espionage-----spying as a "profession." These days the Net, which has already re-made pastimes

as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan's vocation as well.

The last revolution isn't simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen's e-mail. That

kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the past three or four years, the world

wide web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying. The spooks call it "open

source intelligence," and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly influential. in 1995 the CIA

held a contest to see who could compile the most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large

303

margin, was a tiny Virginia company called Open-Source Solutions，whose clear advantage was

its mastery of the electronic world.

Among the firms making the biggest splash in the new world is Straitford, Inc., a private

intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the results of

spying (covering nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like energy-services firm

McDermott International. Many of its predictions are available online at www.straitford.com.

Straifford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of mutually

reinforcing tool for both information collection and distribution, a spymaster's dream. Last week

his firm was busy vacuuming up data bits from the far corners of the world and predicting a crisis

in Ukraine." As soon as that report runs, we'll suddenly get 500 new internet sign-ups from

Ukraine," says Friedman, a former political science professor. "And we'll hear back from some of

them." Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since it can be difficult to tell good

information from bad. That’s where Straitford earns its keep.

Friedman relies on a lean staff in Austin. Several of his staff members have militaryintelligence

backgrounds. He sees the firm's outsider status as the key to its success. Straitford's

briefs don't sound like the usual Washington back-and forthing, whereby agencies avoid dramatic

declarations on the chance they might be wrong. Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its

independent voice.

41. The emergence of the Net has

[A] received support from fans like Donovan.

[B] remolded the intelligence services.

[C] restored many common pastimes.

[D] revived spying as a profession.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章第一段的最后一句话“These days the Net, which has already re-made

pastimes as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan's vocation as well”（如今，

互联网已经改变了像买书和寄信这样的日常活动，也正在改变多诺汶曾经从事的这个职业），

而多诺汶的职业就是espionage，或者说是spying as a profession。四个选项中只有B 选项符

合文章原意，其中reshape 与remold 是同义词，而espionage 与intelligence services 是同义词，

因而B 是正确答案。A 选项与原文意思不符，因此从文章第一句“Wild Bill Donovan would

have loved the Internet”（比尔·多诺汶肯定会喜欢网络），would have 这个虚拟语气的表

304

达说明多诺汶对网络并不知晓。C 选项中的restore 与re-made 意思正好相反，是错误选项。

D 选项中revive 也与reshape 意思相左。

[题目译文]

网络的出现已经。

[A] 得到了像多诺汶这样的网迷的支持

[B] 改变了情报服务的方式

[C] 恢复了许多普通的消遣活动

[D] 复兴了谍报行业

45. Straitford is most proud of its

[A] official status.

[B] nonconformist image.

[C] efficient staff.

[D] military background.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章最后一段的最后一句话“Straitford's briefs don't sound like the usual

Washington back-and forthing, whereby agencies avoid dramatic declarations on the chance they

might be wrong. Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its independent voice”（司特雷福公司

的简报听上去不像华盛顿那样总是闪烁其辞，政府机构往往避免发布引人注目的言论，因为

这些言论可能会出错。弗莱德曼说，司特雷福公司为其独立的声音而感到自豪）。其中B

选项non-conformist 可以说是对independent voice 的解读，因而是正确答案。公司不是官方

机构，显然A 选项错误。而原文并没有强调员工的效率，因此C 选项可以排除。D 选项的

错误在于公司有一些员工具有军队情报服务的背景，但这并不意味着该公司有军事背景，它

只是一家民营私人公司。

[题目译文]

司特雷福公司最为自豪的是其。

[A] 官方地位

[B] 不墨守成规的形象

[C] 高效的员工

[D] 军事北京

**2003**年**Text 2**

To paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, “all that is needed for the triumph of a

misguided cause is that good people do nothing.”One such cause now seeks to end biomedical

research because of the theory that animals have rights ruling out their use in research. Scientists

need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public

and thereby threatening advances in health knowledge and care. Leaders of the animal rights

movement target biomedical research because it depends on public funding, and few people

understand the process of health care research. Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in

research settings, many are perplexed that anyone would deliberately harm an animal.

For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair

was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that opposed

immunizations, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured that

they do, she replied, “Then I would have to say yes.”Asked what will happen when epidemics

return, she said, “Don’t worry, scientists will find some way of using computers.”Such wellmeaning

people just don's understand.

Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate, understandable,

way-in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the

connection between animal research and a grandmother's hip replacement, a father's bypass

operation a baby's vaccinations, and even a pet's shots. To those who are unaware that animal

research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal

research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.

Much can be done. Scientists could “adopt” middle school classes and present their own

research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, lest animal rights misinformation

go unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research institutions could be

opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. Finally, because the

ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its

cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous

statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive medical treatment. If good

people do nothing there is a real possibility that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the

precious embers of medical progress.

306

46. The author begins his article with Edmund Burke's words to

[A] call on scientists to take some actions.

[B] criticize the misguided cause of animal rights.

[C] warn of the doom of biomedical research.

[D] show the triumph of the animal rights movement.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章第一段，Edmund Burke 的__________原话为“all that is needed for the triumph of a

misguided cause is that good people do nothing”（受错误思想引导的事业要想取得胜利，只需

好人袖手旁观）。文章进而在该段第三句话中提出主题，即“Scientists need to respond forcefully

to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public and thereby threatening

advances in health knowledge and care”（科学家应该对动物权利鼓吹者做出有力的回应，因

为他们的言论混淆了公众的视听，从而威胁到卫生知识和医疗服务的进步），也就是说，科

学家们受到了人们的误解，他们应该做出一些行动来反击那些动物权利倡导者。D 选型很显

然不是科学家们希望看到的，因而可以排除。C 选项所言过于悲观，文章并没有指出生物医

学研究已面临doom，而B 选项有一定的迷惑性，但是文中并没有认为科学家应该批判那些

动物权利倡导者，只是指出了后者的无知。

[题目译文]

作者用Edmund Burke 的话作为文章的开头是为了。

[A] 呼吁科学家们采取一些行动

[B] 批评动物权利这个受到错误思想引导的事业

[C] 警告生物医学末日即将到来

[D] 证明动物权利运动取得了胜利

47. Misled people tend to think that using an animal in research is

[A] cruel but natural.

[B] inhuman and unacceptable.

[C] inevitable but vicious.

[D] pointless and wasteful.

[答案] B

307

[解题思路]

文中前三段都在谈论动物权利倡导者反对使用动物进行医学实验，并多次用cruelty 和cruel

这些词汇。文章第三段最后一句话指出“To those… animal research seems wasteful at best and

cruel at worst”（对于他们来说，动物实验说得好听点是浪费，说得不好听就是残忍）。因

此答案中只有B 选型最能表达原文的含义，即以动物做研究既不人道也不可接受。A 和C

选项中的natural 和inevitable 与原文意思相左，因此可以排除。D 选项具有一定干扰性，在

某种程度上也是正确的，但是却没有表示出这些人强烈反对的态度，因而也不是正确选项。

[题目译文]

受误导的人们往往会认为在研究中使用动物是。

[A] 残忍而自然的

[B] 不人道且不可接受的

[C] 难免却邪恶的

[D] 没有意义且浪费的

48. The example of the grandmotherly woman is used to show the public's

[A] discontent with animal research.

[B] ignorance about medical science.

[C] indifference to epidemics.

[D] anxiety about animal rights.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

老奶奶的例子所对应的信息在文章第二段。老太太显然对动物用于一些基础性的研究、如疫

苗的研究等情况一无所知。该段最后一句总结到“Such well-meaning people just don't

understand”（这些善意的人只不过是不了解情况），这正呼应了第一段中说明的公众对医学

研究的无知，因此B 选项为正确答案。C 选项与原文无关，而A、D 选项的错误在于这个例

子的目的并不在于说明公众对动物权利的焦虑或动物研究的不满，且原文也为提及焦虑。

[题目译文]

老奶奶的例子是用来证明公众。

[A] 对动物研究的不满

308

[B] 对医学的无知

[C] 对流行病的漠不关心

[D] 对动物权利的忧虑

49. The author believes that, in face of the challenge from animal rights advocates, scientists

should

[A] communicate more with the public.

[B] employ hi-tech means in research.

[C] feel no shame for their cause.

[D] strive to develop new cures.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题对应信息为第三段的第一句话“Scientists must communicate their message to the public in

a compassionate, understandable, way-in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology”

（科学家必须把他们的信息传达给公众，并且要使用有通俗易懂且能够引起共鸣的语言，而

不要使用分子生物学的专业术语），也就是为了更好地对付动物权利倡导者，科学家需要用

更多简明的语言与公众交流以获得支持和理解，因此A 为正确选项。B、C、D 都不是文中

提议的应对方法。

[题目译文]

作者相信，面对动物权利倡导者的挑战，科学家们应该。

[A] 多余公众进行交流

[B] 在研究中采用高科技的手段

[C] 不要为自己的事业感到惭愧

[D] 努力发展新的疗法

**2003**年**Text 3**

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems,

causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads

accounted for under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series of

mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the freight moved

309

by major rail carriers.

Supporters of the new super systems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial cost

reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by

fierce competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities

traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads

therefore have them by the throat.

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only

one rail company. Railroads typically charge such “captive” shippers 20 to 30 percent more than

they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they are being

overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government's Surface Transportation Board for

rate relief, but the process is expensive, time consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.

Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the long

run it reduces everyone's cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue,

shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so,

leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line. It's theory to which many

economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which

companies will flourish and which will fail. “Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who

wins and who loses in the marketplace?” asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who

frequently represents shipper.

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be his with a round of huge rate increases.

The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortuning fortunes, still does not earn

enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet

railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street cheering them on.

Consider the .2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail's

net railway operating income in 1996 was just million, less than half of the carrying costs of the

transaction. Who's going to pay for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will,

as Norfolk Southern and CSX increase their grip on the market.

51. According to those who support mergers railway monopoly is unlikely because

[A] cost reduction is based on competition.

[B] services call for cross-trade coordination.

[C] outside competitors will continue to exist.

[D] shippers will have the railway by the throat.

310

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息为第二段，其中该段第二句话说“Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is

removed by fierce competition from trucks”（他们认为，在卡车运输的激烈竞争面前，垄断

的威胁已经不复存在）。因此，支持铁路公司合并的人们认为来自卡车运输的竞争会阻止铁

路垄断的形成，因此只有C 选项符合题意，其中“outside competition”指的就是“competition

from trucks”。对于A 选项，尽管该段第一句提到了“Supporters of the new super systems argue

that these mergers will allow for substantial cost reductions and better coordinated service”（组建

超大型铁路集团的支持者们认为，兼并将带来成本的大幅降低，提高协调服务），但并没有

提到成本降低与竞争的关系。B 选项的“cross-trade coordination”在原文没有提及。D 选项

针对的是该段最后一句“But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities traveling

long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads therefore

have them by the throat”（但许多客户却抱怨说，对于依赖长途运输的大宗商品如煤炭、化

学制品和粮食来说，由于公路运输花费太大，因此铁路公司“卡住了他们的脖子”），但却

恰恰颠倒了原句的主语和宾语，具有很强的干扰性。

[题目译文]

根据那些支持合并的人们的观点，铁路垄断不可能发生，因为。

[A] 成本的降低以竞争为基础

[B] 服务业需要跨行业的协调

[C] 外部竞争者将会继续存在

[D] 托运人将控制铁路运输

55. According to the text, the cost increase in the rail industry is mainly caused by

[A] the continuing acquisition.

[B] the growing traffic.

[C] the cheering Wall Street.

[D] the shrinking market.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

311

本题的对应信息在文章的最后一段。该段第一至三句谈到“Many captive shippers also worry

they will soon be his with a round of huge rate increases. The railroad industry as a whole, despite

its brightening fortuning fortunes, still does not earn enough to cover the cost of the capital it must

invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one

another, with Wall Street cheering them on”（许多“受制”客户还担心他们很快将遭遇一轮

新的大幅涨价。从整体来说，虽然铁路行业有耀眼的资产，但它的收入仍然不足以支付为满

足不断增长的运输需要而进行的固定资产投资。然而铁路公司仍然继续贷款数十亿美元来进

行相互兼并，而华尔街也鼓励它们这样做），后面还举了例子说明铁路公司由于并购而借入

了大量资金，其与公司收入之间的缺口恐怕就要托运人来填补了，从而导致铁路行业成本的

进一步上升，因此A 选项符合原文。B 选项对应于第二句话中的“surging traffic”，但这并

不是最主要的原因。而C、D 选项则与题干的问题无关。

[题目译文]

根据本文，铁路业成本的增加主要是由于。

[A] 持续的购置

[B] 日益繁忙的交通

[C] 令人振奋的华尔街

[D] 缩小的市场

It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional

Small wonder. Americans' life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century. Failing hips

can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minuts surgical

procedure. Such advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was unimaginable when

I entered medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure death-and our

failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.

Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal

conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a

problem to be solved. Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand

everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it's useless. The most obvious example is latestage

cancer care. Physicians-frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of

hope in the patient-too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

In1950, the U.S. spent .7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be billion. Anyone can

see this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars conclude

312

that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains

life beyond a certain age-----say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been

quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty todie and get out of the way”, so that

younger, healthier people can realize their potential.

I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond,

and remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to

be 53.Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is in her 70s, and former Surgeon General

C.Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s.These leaders are living proof that prevention

works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-

year-old, I wish to age as productively as they have.

Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. Ask a physician, I know the

most costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that people in

Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier

lives than we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while

underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people's lives.

57. The author uses the example of cancer patients to show that

[A] medical resources are often wasted.

[B] doctors are helpless against fatal diseases.

[C] some treatments are too aggressive.

[D] medical costs are becoming unaffordable.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

the example of cancer patients 出现在文章第二段第四句话“The most obvious example is latestage

cancer care”（最明显的例子是晚期癌症的治疗），它用来具体例证前一句话的观点，

即“Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can

possibly be done for us, even if it's useless”（由于医疗费用由第三方支付，我们常常要求用尽

所有的医疗手段为我们治疗，哪怕这些治疗不起任何作用）。“useless”正是说明很都医疗资

源都被浪费了，正好对应于A 选项。D 选项在该段中没有提及，可以排除。B 和C 选项都

是该段第三句话中的一些细节，并不是作者想通过例子说明的问题。

[题目译文]

作者用癌症患者的例子是想证明。

313

[A] 医疗资源经常被浪费

[B] 医生对绝症都无力回天

[C] 有些治疗过于大胆

[D] 医疗费用变得越来越无法承受

59. In contrast to the U.S., Japan and Sweden are funding their medical care

[A]. more flexibly.

[B] more extravagantly.

[C].more cautiously.

[D] more reasonably.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应信息为最后一段的第三句话“I also know that people in Japan and Sweden, countries

that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than we have”（我也深

知在医疗开销少得多的日本和瑞典，人们不仅活得比我们久，而且还比我们健康）。此外，

最后一句进一步指出“As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while

underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people's lives”（作为一个国家，

我们可能在寻求无法奏效的治疗方法上花钱太多，而在研究能提高人们生活质量的简单方法

上投入太少），因此作者认为日本和瑞典人在医疗上的花费更加理性，更加合理，因此D

选项为正确答案。

[题目译文]

与美国相比，日本和瑞典在医疗方面的投入。

[A] 更加灵活

[B] 更加奢侈

[C] 更加谨慎

[D] 更加合理

**2004**年**Text 1**

Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across CareerBuilder, a job

database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site’s personal

314

search agent. It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as location, title,

and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the database. Redmon chose

the keywords legal, intellectual property, and Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, he got his first

notification of an opening. “I struck gold,” says Redmon, who E-mailed his resume to the

employer and won a position as in-house counsel for a company.

With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding promising openings can be

time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the databases.

But although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. Narrowing your

criteria, for example, may work against you: “Every time you answer a question you eliminate a

possibility.” says one expert.

For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept——what you think you want to

do——then broaden it. “None of these programs do that,” says another expert. “There‘s no career

counseling implicit in all of this.” Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip

service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database ； when you get E-mail ， consider it a

reminder to check the database again. “I would not rely on agents for finding everything that is

added to a database that might interest me,” says the author of a job-searching guide.

Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite’s agent sends

out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only three

potential jobs——those it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in the database;

job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them——and they do. “On the day after we

send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our traffic,” says Seth Peets, vice president of

marketing for CareerSite.

Even those who aren‘t hunting for jobs may find search agents worthwhile. Some use them to

keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on compensation to

arm themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily employed, Redmon maintains his

agent at CareerBuilder. “You always keep your eyes open,” he says. Working with a personal

search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for you.

41. How did Redmon find his job?

[A] By searching openings in a job database.

[B] By posting a matching position in a database.

[C] By using a special service of a database.

[D] By E-mailing his resume to a database.

[答案] C

315

[解题思路]

本题对应信息为文章第一段。四个选项都提到了database（数据库），对于该数据库可描述

在第一段的第三句“It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as location,

title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the database”（这是一

种互动功能的搜索器，访问者可以键入诸如地点、职位和薪水等的求职要求，等到资料库里

有了相应的工作职位，系统就会发电子邮件给他们。），同时下面两句也说明“Redmon chose

the keywords legal, intellectual property, and Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, he got his first

notification of an opening”（Redmon 输入了法律、知识产权和哥伦比亚特区华盛顿这些关键

词，三周后，他收到了第一份职位空缺通知）。因此Redmond 既没有在数据库中寻找职位、

也没有在上面发布匹配的职位（他只是输入了自己要求职位的关键信息），同时也没有把自

己的简历发给了数据库，因此A、B、D 选择均可排除，正确答案为C。所谓的“special service”

就是“personal search agent”。

[题目译文]

Redmon 是如何找到工作的？

[A] 通过在一个工作数据库中寻找空缺职位

[B] 通过在一个数据库中张贴相匹配的职位

[C] 通过使用一个数据库中的特殊服务

[D] 通过发简历到一个数据库

42. Which of the following can be a disadvantage of search agents?

[A] Lack of counseling.

[B] Limited number of visits.

[C] Lower efficiency.

[D] Fewer successful matches.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题要求判断search agent 的缺点，而文章第三段第三句话的引文中指出，“There‘s no career

counseling implicit in all of this”（整个系统中没有任何关于就业咨询的内容），也就是说这

些搜索代理都缺乏咨询方面的服务，因此A 为正确答案。而B、C、D 选项在文中并没有明

确提及，因而都是干扰选项，可以排除。

316

[题目译文]

下面的哪一项是搜索代理的缺点？

[A] 缺乏咨询服务

[B] 有限的访问量

[C] 较低的效率

44. Why does CareerSite’s agent offer each job hunter only three job options?

[A] To focus on better job matches.

[B] To attract more returning visits.

[C] To reserve space for more messages.

[D] To increase the rate of success.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息为文章第四段，仔细分析可以发现该段的几句话都是围绕着第一句段落主题

句“Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return”（有的网站尽力设计自己的代

理系统，以吸引求职者的回访展开的。CareerSite 给每位求职者只发送它认为最好的三个职

位，但是数据库中其实有更多的职位，因此访客不得不回到数据库中访问，于是便有了更多

的回头率，因此B 选项如何原文。A 选项的错误在于该代理给客户的电子邮件中已经包含

了最好的职位信息，因此无需关注更好的职位。而C、D 选项则都是无中生有，在文中并没

有依据。

[题目译文]

为什么“打造事业”代理给每一个找工作的人只提供三个工作选择？

[A] 为了突出更好的工作匹配

[B] 为了吸引更多的回头客

[C] 为了给更多信息留下空间

[D] 为了提高成功率

45. Which of the following is true according to the text?

[A] Personal search agents are indispensable to job-hunters.

[B] Some sites keep E-mailing job seekers to trace their demands.

[C] Personal search agents are also helpful to those already employed.

317

[D] Some agents stop sending information to people once they are employed.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

首先，虽然本文从始至终在谈论使用搜索代理对找工作的帮助，但并没有谈到这种工具对找

工作的人来说是不可或缺的，因此A 选项错误。其次，文中只谈到搜索代理用电子邮件给

客户发送职位信息，但并没有跟踪其需求，因此B 选项也是错误的，此外文中最后一段提

到keep a close watch on the demand 的是那些已经有工作的人，不是搜索代理。D 选项的表

述在文中没有提到。C 选项的对应信息在文章最后一段，“Even those who aren‘t hunting for

jobs may find search agents worthwhile”（即使那些并不需要找工作的人也觉得搜索代理很有

用处），因此为正确选项。

[题目译文]

下列哪一项符合文意？

[A] 个人搜索代理对于找工作的人们来说是必不可少的。

[B] 有些网站一直给找工作的人发邮件以跟踪他们的需求

[C] 个人搜索代理也能够帮助那些已经有工作的人

[D] 人们一旦找到了工作，那些一些代理就不再给这些人发送信息

Over the past century， all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned or

made illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet

unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with

a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.

It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over Zodiac

cars when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that

Adam Abbott has in life over Zoeuml; Zysman. English names are fairly evenly spread between

the halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people have surnames beginning

with letters between A and K.

Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C

respectively; and 26 of George Bush‘s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first

half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking， six of the seven heads

of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush,

318

Chirac, Chrétien and Koizumi）. The world’s three top central bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg

and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese

characters. As are the world‘s five richest men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).

Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the

alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot sets in early. At the start of the first year in infant

school， teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their

names. So short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row ， and is rarely asked the

improving questions posed by those insensitive teachers. At the time the alphabetically

disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications,

because they get less individual attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.

The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their

awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ. Shortlists

for job interviews, election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all tend to be

drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they plough through them.

46. What does the author intend to illustrate with AAA A cars and Zodiac cars？

[A] A kind of overlooked inequality.

[B] A type of conspicuous bias.

[C] A type of personal prejudice.

[D] A kind of brand discrimination.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

AAAA 和Zodiac 汽车出租公司这个例子出现在文章的第二段，是说人们平时通过查电话号

码簿叫出租车的时候，名字以A 开头的公司比名字以Z 开头的公司远远要有优势，这就是

第一段中提到的“discrimination of alphabetism”（字母表主义）。同时该段明确指出这种歧

视一一直没有受到人们的注意，也就是被忽视。因此本题题干的例子是用来解释说明第一段

提出的文章中心思想，因此正确答案为A，其中overlooked 对应于第一段第三句的unaware of

， 而inequality 对应于该段第一句的unfairness 和discrimination。B、C 选项中bias, prejudice

都是discrimination 的同义词，但conspicuous 与原文正好相反，personal 也与原文不符合。

D 选项brand（商标）也没有在文中提到。本题的关键是抓住区分几个修饰词的含义。

[题目译文]

作者用AAAA 和Zodiac 汽车出租公司的例子是想要说明什么？

319

[A] 一种被忽视的不平等

[B] 一种明显的歧视

[C] 一种个人偏见

[D] 一种品牌偏见

50. Which of the following is true according to the text?

[A] People with surnames beginning with N to Z are often ill-treated.

[B] VIPs in the Western world gain a great deal from alphabetism.

[C] The campaign to eliminate alphabetism still has a long way to go.

[D] Putting things alphabetically may lead to unintentional bias.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

判断这种正误题需要与原文逐项对应信息。A 选项ill-treated（受虐待）不符合原文，文章

只谈及歧视，但人们并无受虐待，因此A 选项错误。B 选项的主语VIP 指的是所有的大人

物，但文章中虽举例说一部分大人物姓名排在字母表的前一半，却并没有如此绝对的表述，

因此B 选项错误。C 选项在文中并没有提及。D 选项总结了全文的观点，是正确选项，说

明按字母排序这种看似公平的方法实际上却导致了无意（unintentional）的歧视。

[题目译文]

下面哪项符合文意？

[A] 那些姓氏以N-Z 字母靠头的人们经常受到不好的待遇。

[B] 西方国家中的一些重要人物从字母排序主义中获益颇多

[C] 消除字母排序主义的运动还有很长的路要走

[D] 按照字母排序可能在无意中造成了偏见。

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet. But the 47-

year-old manicurist isn’t cutting, filing or polishing as many nails as she’d like to. Most of her

clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped

showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. “I’m a good economic indicator,” she says. “I

provide a service that people can do without when they’re concerned about saving some dollars.”

So Spero is downscaling, shopping at a middle-brow Dillard’s department store near her suburban

320

Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. “I don’t know if other clients are going to abandon

me, too.” she says.

Even before Alan Greenspan’s admission that America’s red-hot economy is cooling, lots of

working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships to Gap

outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who

last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious

approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last

year’s pace. But don’t sound any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not

panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy’s long-term prospects, even as

they do some modest belt-tightening.

Consumers say they’re not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own fortunes

still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, “there’s a

new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by Wall Street

bonuses,” says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied

overbidding quiets. “Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three,” says John

Deadly, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their

ability to find and keep a job.

Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for lower

interest rates. Employers wouldn’t mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers

seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary

ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. Getting a table at Manhattan’s hot

new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co.

may still be worth toasting.

54. Why can many people see “silver linings” to the economic slowdown?

[A] They would benefit in certain ways.

[B] The stock market shows signs of recovery.

[C] Such a slowdown usually precedes a boom.

[D] The purchasing power would be enhanced.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

做本题的关键不在于了解“silver linings”这个词组的含义，而在于准确定位对应信息，即

文章的最后一段。纵观该段，主要谈论的内容是经济不景气带来的一些好处，如利率降低有

321

利于购房、高级餐厅的价格降低等，四个选项中只有A 选项符合最后一段的意思。“silver

linings”这个词组的含义也正是“黑暗中的一线希望”。B 选项虽然在原文中有所提及，但

这与目前的经济形势无关。C、D 选项在文中没有提及，考生不要盲目地用自己的经济知识

去判断，而要紧紧围绕原文。

为什么很多人从经济减速中看到了希望？

[A] 他们会以一些方式获益。

Americans today don‘t place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, entertainers,

and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our children to get a practical

education——not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive antiintellectualism

in our schools aren’t difficult to find.

“Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual,”

says education writer Diane Ravitch. “Schools could be a counterbalance.” Razitch‘s latest bock,

_Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms_, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our

schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for

intellectual pursuits.

But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them

vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their ideas

and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing

along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, “We will become a second-rate country. We will have a

less civil society.”

“Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor Richard

Hofstadter in Anti-Intellectualism in American life, a Pulitzer Prize winning book on the roots of

anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of our history, says

Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of

elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence have been considered more noble

qualities than anything you could learn from a book.

322

Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and rigorous

book learning put unnatural restraints on children: “We are shut up in schools and college

recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know

a thing.” Mark Twain‘s Huckleberry Finn exemplified American anti-intellectualism. Its hero

avoids being civilized——going to school and learning to read——so he can preserve his innate

goodness.

Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we reluctantly

admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to

grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes,

criticizes and imagines.

School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country‘s educational

system is in the grips of people who “joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility to intellect

and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least intellectual promise.”

56. What do American parents expect their children to acquire in school?

[A] The habit of thinking independently.

[B] Profound knowledge of the world.

[C] Practical abilities for future career.

[D] The confidence in intellectual pursuits.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息为文章第一段第三句话“Even our schools are where we send our children to

get a practical education——not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge”（学校也只不

过是我们把孩子送去获得实用教育——而不是为了知识而追求知识的地方），因此C 选项

与此正好吻合，而其他三项看似有道理，却与文章的内容没有关系。

美国的父母们希望他们的孩子在学校里学到什么？

[A] 独立思考的习惯

[B] 关于世界的深入知识

59. Emerson, according to the text, is probably

[A] a pioneer of education reform.

[B] an opponent of intellectualism.

[C] a scholar in favor of intellect.

[D] an advocate of regular schooling.

第五段第一句话指出“Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought

schooling and rigorous book learning put unnatural restraints on children”（爱默生和其他一些

超自然主义哲学家认为学校教育和高强度的书本学习会使孩子受到不自然的限），这说明爱

默生反对学校进行智力和知识教育，因此答案显然是B。C 选项与B 选项的意思相反，是错

误答案。D 选项中regular schooling 属无中生有，原文并没有提及。A 选项也与文章无关。

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague

has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be

outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human”, with the underlying assumption that

other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by

Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been

published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys, which have all the

necessary ingredients to capture the public imagination. They look cute. They are good-natured,

co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their finicky female

324

human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services”

than males (although why this is so remains a mystery).

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr Brosnan's and Dr de Waal's study. The

researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the

monkeys were happy enough to swap pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two

monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the

other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.

In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when

one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers

over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her

token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the

chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the

other chamber (in the absence of an actual monkey able to eat it) was enough to induce sullen

behaviour in a female capuchin.

Dr Brosnan and Dr de Waal report that such behaviour is unusual in their trained monkeys. During

two years of bartering prior to these experiments, failure to exchange tokens for food occurred in

fewer than 5% of trials. And what made the behaviour even more extraordinary was that these

monkeys forfeited food that they could see—and which they would have readily accepted in

almost any other set of circumstances.

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In

the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable

only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems,

are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings

abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness

evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor

that the species had 35m years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

23. Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they are

[A] more inclined to weigh what they get.

[B] attentive to researchers’ instructions.

[C] nice in both appearance and temperament.

[D] more generous than their male companions.

[答案] A

本文的对应信息在文章的第二段。第二段中先谈到了母卷尾猴的特征有cute, good-natured,

cooperative, share food readily 等，这些分别与B、C、D 选项符合。下一句话提到，最重要

的是，“它们往往比雄性猴子更注重商品和服务的价值”，这才是最重要的原因。A 选项中

“weigh”这个词的意思是“衡量”，该次是解题的关键，但是也可以通过排除其他三个选项得

出正确答案。

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the

doubters insisted that we didn't know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science

uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government

should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades,

some 10 million smokers went to early graves.

There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the

growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences,

enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is definitely warming and that

the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect

ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Albert, added this key point in the

preface to the panel's report "Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with

the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important

policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of

present actions."

Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global

warming is incomplete, that it's OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure.

This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With

the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.

Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it's obvious that a majority of the

president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they

continue to press for more research -- a classic case of "paralysis by analysis."

To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and

oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won't take the legislative

initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic

Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry,

is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to

meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new

plants be environmentally sound.

26. An argument made by supporters of smoking was that

[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death.

[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant.

[C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life.

[D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense.

本题对应的是文章的第一段，首先要判断题干中提高的supporter 就是第一句话中的doubter，

因此才能正确判断supporter 的观点。首先，A 选项在原文中没有明确的表述，因而不是正

确答案。B 选项也与第一段的最后一句相矛盾，1000 万烟民死亡这个数字显然不能说是

insigfinicant。而D 选项中用到的“nonsense”这个词在文章中是作者用来批判这些吸烟支持

者们所用的词语，作者认为他们的理由才是“胡说八道”。关于C 选项，文中提到支持吸

烟的人们认为反对吸烟的人是要破坏我们的生活方式，也就是说他们认为人们有权利选择自

己的生活方式，因此C 是正确选项。

[题目译文]

吸烟支持者的一个观点是

[A] 吸烟和死亡之间的关系没有科学的证明

[B] 过去几十年烟民过早死亡的人数并不多

[C] 人类拥有选择自己生活方式的自由

Of all the components of a good night's sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In

dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century

ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our

unconscious desires and rears, by the late 1970s. neurologists had switched to thinking of them as

just “mental noise” the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep.

329

Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind's emotional thermostat, regulating

moods while the brain is “off-line”. And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful

mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us

sleep and feel better, “It's your dream” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago's

Medical Center. “If you don't like it, change it.”

Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye

movement) sleep-when most vivid dreams occur-as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric

Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved, the

limbic system (the “emotional brain”)is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center of

intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy of depressed, and

those feelings can stay with us all day” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr, William Dement.

The link between dreams and emotions show up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most

people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before

awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day.

Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional

significance of the day’s events—until, it appears, we begins to dream.

And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise

conscious control over recurring bad dreams As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting

about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead, the next time is occurs, try to

wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it

in their sleep.

At the end of the day, there's probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless

they keep us from sleeping of “we wake u in a panic, ”Cartwright says Terrorism, economic

uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people's anxiety. Those suffering

from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist For the rest of us, the brain has its

ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep-or rather dream-on it and you'll feel better in the

morning.

31. Researchers have come to believe that dreams

[A] can be modified in their courses.

[B] are susceptible to emotional changes.

[C] reflect our innermost desires and fears.

[D] are a random outcome of neural repairs.

其强烈的精神事件不仅可以得到利用，而且还能受到有意识的控制）、“If you don't like it,

change it”（如果你不喜欢它，那就改变它）这些句子都说明梦是可以被改变的，而A 选项

中的modify 这个词时change 的同义词。B、C、D 选项的表述都与第一段的重点内容无关，

均可排除。

本文的对应信息在文章第三段第二句话，“Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in

the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening”（大多数人在前半夜似乎会更容

易做恶梦，等到快睡醒前就逐渐变为较愉快的梦），因此A 和C 选项的表述显然是不对的。

至于B 选项，文中说上半夜的梦是恶梦，只有会变得happier，这个是相对于原来的恶梦而

[B] Seek professional help.

[C]. Exercise conscious control.

[D] Avoid anxiety in the daytime.

book, Doing Our Own Thing. The Degradation of language and Music and why we should like,

332

care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views,

sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.

Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the

decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic specialty is language history and change, and he

sees the gradual disappearance of “whom”, for example, to be natural and no more regrettable

than the loss of the case-ending of Old English.

But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing”, has spelt the death of

formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated

tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then

has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal,

performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written

English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.

Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that

Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle,

why we should, like care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language,

including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive-there exists no

language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do,

that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry

in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem old-fashioned to

most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly

necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms-he is really grieving over the loss of

something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china”.

A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.

36. According to Mc Whorter, the decline of formal English

[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms.

[B] is but all too natural in language development.

[C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture.

[D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

333

做本题需要从文中一一对应信息。首先，最后一段中McWhorte“r proposes no radical education

reform”（并没有提出激进的教育改革方案），因此A 选项错误。第二段的第二句话说“he sees

the gradual disappearance of “whom”, for example, to be natural”（他认为像“whom”这个词

的逐渐消失是自然的），这句话与B 选项的意思符合。第一段最后一句指出，“sees the triumph

of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English”（认为发生在20 世纪60

年代的反文化运动的胜利看成是规范英语退化的原因），因此C 选项是错误的。前三段都

提到了the 1960s，但是都没有出现public attitudes，因此D 选项也可以排除。

[题目译文]

McWhorter 认为正式英语的退化

[A] 是激进的教育改革中不可避免的。

[B] 在语言的发展过程中是在正常不过的事情了/

[C] 已经引起了关于反文化的争论

[D] 导致了20 世纪60 年代公众态度的变化

38. To which of the following statements would Mc Whorter most likely agree?

[A] Logical thinking is not necessarily related to the way we talk.

[B]. Black English can be more expressive than Standard English.

[C]. Non-standard varieties of human language are just as entertaining.

[D] Of all the varieties, Standard English Can best convey complex ideas.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本文第四段中提到，“all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black

English, can be powerfully expressive-there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot

convey complex ideas”（人类语言的各种文化都有极强的表现力，即使是像黑人英语这样的

的非标准语言——世界上任何语言或方言都能表达复杂的思想），因此B、D 选项的表述是

错误的。C 选项的表述与文章相应内容无关。而A 选项正是对“He is not arguing, as many do,

that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper”（他并没有像许多人那样认

为因为我们的思维因为说话不严格就不再有条理）这句话的解释，是正确答案。

[题目译文]

McWhorter 最有可能认同以下哪一个观点？

334

[A] 逻辑思维不一定与我们的说话方式有关

[B] 黑人英语可能比标准英语更有表现力

[C] 不标准的人类语言同样能够使人们得到娱乐

[D] 在所有的变体中，标准英语最能表达复杂的思想

39. The description of Russians' love of memorizing poetry shows the author's

[A] interest in their language.

[B] appreciation of their efforts.

[C] admiration for their memory.

[D] contempt for their old-fashionedness.

[答案] B

本题对应信息为最后一段第一句话“Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry

large chunks of memorized poetry in their heads”（俄国人深爱着自己的语言，他们会把大段

大段的诗歌背下来）可采用排除法。首先，作者没有提到俄罗斯人对语言的感情而非兴趣，

因此可以排除A。至于C 选项，文中只提到了memorize（背诵）这个词，而没有谈到memory

（记忆），因此也可排除。而old-fashioned 指的是意大利人，因此D 选项也可以排除。正

确答案为C 选项。

关于俄罗斯人喜爱背诵诗歌的描述表明作者

[A] 对他们的语言感兴趣

[B] 欣赏他们做出的努力

[C] 羡慕他们的记忆力

In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for

homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the

casualness and absence of consumption” launched by the 19th--century department stores that

offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a

knowledgeable elite.” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background.

335

This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports

are other forces for homogenization.

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating

but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports

that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented level nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998

immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent .In the 10 years prior to 1990,

3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000.

Now, consider three indices of assimilation –language, home ownership and intermarriage.

The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most

common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The

children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the

original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America

as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign–born immigrants who had arrived before 1970

had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born

Americans.

Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S –born

whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-

Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian–American women are married to non-Asians.

Rodriguez note that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrant living within

the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”

Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to

have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s

social induces suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.

22. According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century

[A] played a role in the spread of popular culture.

[B] became intimate shops for common consumers.

[C] satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite.

[D] owed its emergence to the culture of consumption

Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry-William Shakespeare-but there are

two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare

Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial

Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not

to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other

sights.

The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They

frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness.

It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself

an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise - making.

The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus- and often take in

Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side – don’t usually see the plays, and some of them

are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight -

seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the

town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into

the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.

The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy

of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in

town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there,

which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the

Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.

338

Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy.

(The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were

94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that

costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.

It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people

who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They

all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) –lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing

jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the

theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them

when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.

29. According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because

[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending

[B] the company is financially ill-managed

[C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable

[D] the theatre attendance is on the rise

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应的信息是文章第五段。小镇居民们不认为RSC 需要补贴，理由为该段括号中的内

容，即“The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats

were 94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better”（剧院已经连续三年打破

了上座率纪录。去年一整年剧院1431 个座位的上坐率达到了94%，今年还会更高）。简而

言之就是剧院的上座率一直在提高，因此居民们认为RSC 赚钱应该不成问题，所以正确答

案为D。A 选项的错误原因在于第五段最后一句话明确提到剧院的票价一直保持在较低的水

平，并没有通过提高票价来弥补支出。B 选项的错误在于并没有提及RSC 是否存在经营不

善的问题。C 选项的错误在于信息错位，即演员的行为是否为社会所接受这一信息并没有出

When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large

animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived, the large, slow-growing animals

were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be

happening in the oceans.

That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years what researchers such as Ransom

Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half

a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods de not attempt to estimate the

actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the

ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in

Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is

reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas,

it has halved again since then.

Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative, one reason for this is that fishing

technology has improved Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which

were not available 50 years ago that means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being

caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded

by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with

fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since to baited hooks would have

been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in

the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That

is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise.

Dr. Myers and Dr. worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future

management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among

marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline”. The notion is that people have failed to detect the

massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a

relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum

sustainable yield that can be cropped form a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is

about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do

business.

34. Dr Myers and other researchers hold that

340

[A] people should look for a baseline that can’t work for a longer time

[B] fisheries should keep the yield below 50% of the biomass

[C] the ocean biomass should restored its original level.

[D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situation.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

文章最后一段第二句话指出：They believe the date support an idea current among marine

biologists, that of the “shifting baseline” （他们相信自己的数据恰恰体现了一个目前在海洋生

物学家中非常流行的观点，那就是"改变基线"）。shifiting （活动的）这个词暗示根据情况

进行调整，所以正确答案是D。A 选项明显是错误，但B、C 选项都很具有欺骗性，因为文

章最后一段倒数第二句话使用了yield. fishery, biomass, 50%, its original level 等词语，但是这

两个选项都与原文不符，“the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped form a fishery

comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels”（当一种目标生

物的生物量大约达到原始水平的50%时，就可以从一个渔场收获到最大程度的可持续发展

的鱼储量），B、C 选项的keep 和restore 都无中生有。

Myers 博士和其他研究者们认为

[A] 人们应该寻找一个能在更长时间内有效的起点。

[B] 渔场应该将其产出限制在生物量的50%以内

Many things make people think artists are weird and the weirdest may be this: artists only job is

to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited

for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as

insipid, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s

flowers of evil.

You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen

such misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of

341

innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the

world today.

After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting

happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass

media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted,

lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy,

the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls

were in peril and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly

need their art to be a bummer too.

Today the messages your average Westerner is bombarded with are not religious but

commercial, and forever happy .Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling,

smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And

since these messages have an agenda--to lure us to open our wallets to make the very idea of

happiness seem unreliable. "Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before

we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

What we forget--what our economy depends on is forgetting--is that happiness is more than

pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss

and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone to tell

us as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that

happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. Its a message even more bitter than a

clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

40. Which of the following is true of the text?

[A] Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.

[B] Art provides a balance between expectation and reality.

[C] People feel disappointed at the realities of morality.

[D] mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

[答案] A

西方，在大众传媒和文学普及之前，最有效的大众媒体是教堂，它提醒信徒们，他们的灵魂

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup

tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to

have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the

European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find

this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.

What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain

astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen

capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive

children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.

Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he

believes strongly in "none of the above." Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear

engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he

switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a

person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. "With the first subject, after about 20

hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20," Ericsson recalls. "He kept improving, and

after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers."

343

This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically

determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise

than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their

abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person "encodes" the

information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson

determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than

simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback

and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of

pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and

biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers.

Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated.

Or, put another way, expert performers -- whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer

programming -- are nearly always made, not born.

21． The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to

[AI stress the importance of professional training.

[B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.

[C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.

[D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others.

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column

called “Ask Marilyn." People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at

a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 -- the highest score ever

recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has

been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit

confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What's

the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It's not

obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to

answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.

Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be

smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from

neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?

346

The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests

are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-

Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children's

version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists,

although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like

vos Savant's are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population

distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age

and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)

and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.

Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in

school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence

Testing?", Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to

measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life

success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations

change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under

low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with

leadership -- that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that

test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.

26. Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?

[A] Answering philosophical questions.

[B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.

[C] Telling the differences between certain concepts.

[D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.

[答案] D

本题对应于文章第一段的第三句话“IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to

envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other

similar tasks”（智商测试要求你完成一些文字和图像的分析，要求你在纸张被折叠和剪切后

想象它的形状，要求你推论数字的顺序，还有其他类似的项目），显然A 和C 选项的内容

不包括其中，因而是错误选项。B 选项的表述与原文“to envision paper after it has been folded

and cut”意思相左，也可排除。Ｄ选项对应于“to complete verbal and visual analogies”，因

而是正确答案。

下列的哪一项在智商测试中有所要求？

[A] 回答哲学问题

[B] 把纸折成或剪成不同的形状

[C] 区别一些概念之间不同

[D] 根据给定的词汇或者图像选择相似的词汇或图像。

28. People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant's because

[A] the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.

[B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.

[C] vos Savant's case is an extreme one that will not repeat.

[D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.

[答案] Ａ

本题的对应信息在文章第二段的第四句话“Superhigh scores like vos Savant's are no longer

possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers,

rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100”（ 像

沃斯•萨文特那么高的分数也再也不可能出现了，因为现在的分数依据的是相同年龄者的统

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard

work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been transformed by economic risk and

new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from

solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family

economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications

of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today's

families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost

the parachute they once had in times of financial setback -- a back-up earner (usually Mom) who

could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This "added-worker

effect" could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to

help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made

up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement

income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions

of families who must worry about interest-rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality

that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush

campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all

of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families,

the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by

families have risen -- and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative

halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk

for families' future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as

the odds of having a weak elderly parent -- and all the attendant need for physical and financial

assistance -- have jumped eightfold in just one generation.

From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an

opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening

acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The

financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.

31 Today’s double-income families are at greater financial risk in that

[A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.

[B] their chances of being laid off have greatly increased.

[C] they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics.

349

[D] they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章的第二段。A 和D 选项中的“safety net”和“unemployment or disability

insurance”对应于该段倒数第二句“This "added-worker effect" could support the safety net

offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times”（

这种“额外工人效应”可以支持由失业保险或残疾保险提供的安全网，以便帮助家庭渡过难

关），但显然与原文意思相反，因为这种安全网依旧存在，因此两个选项均可排除。B 选项

在文中没有提及。C 选项对应于第三、四句话“Today's families have budgeted to the limits of

their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of

financial setback -- a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the

primary earner got laid off or fell sick”（ 如今的家庭根据双份收入限度安排开支。因此，它

们失去了在经济萧条时期曾经有过的缓解举措——一个后备挣钱者（通常是母亲），她可以

在家庭的主要挣钱者失业或者病倒的时候出去工作），即现代家庭中一旦遭遇变故则经济上

有可能垮下来，因此C 是正确选项。

[题目译文]

现在的双收入家庭面临很大的财务风险，因为

[A] 他们以前享受的安全网已经消失了

[B] 他们失业的几率大大增强了

[C] 他们面对家庭经济状况的改变更加脆弱

[D] 他们被剥夺了失业和残疾保险

32. As a result of President Bush's reform, retired people may have

[A] a higher sense of security.

[B] less secured payments.

[C] less chance to invest.

[D] a guaranteed future.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

350

布什总统的这项政策出现在文章的第三段的第三句话“For much of the past year, President

Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with retirees trading much

or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns”（ 在去年的

大部分时间里，布什总统一直致力于将社会保险体制转变成一种储蓄存款账户模式，要求退

休人员将其大多数或所有保障金变成基于投资回报所得的报酬），显然B 为正确答案，而

其余三个选项均与原文意思相反。

[题目译文]

布什总统的改革导致了退休人员可能会有

[A] 更强的安全感

[B] 更少有保证的收入

[C] 更少投资的机会

[D] 一个有保障的未来

[A] help reduce the cost of healthcare.

[B] popularize among the middle class.

[C] compensate for the reduced pensions.

[D] increase the families' investment risk.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第三段的第三句话“For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the

absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen -- and newly

fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with

much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families' future healthcare”（

对于更年轻的家庭来说，前景不容乐观。卫生保健的绝对成本和家庭承担份额都上涨了——

而且，最近实施的健康储蓄计划正在从立法机关扩展到沃尔玛员工，家庭将来的医疗保健都

有更高的扣除成分和很大的风险投资），其中“much higher deductibles”和“a large new dose of

investment risk”等信息说明家庭投资风险的增长，因此D 为正确选项。

[题目译文]

根据本文作者，健康储蓄计划将会

[A] 帮助减少医疗保健的成本

[B] 在中产阶级中得到普及

[C] 补偿减少的退休金

[D] 增加家庭的投资风险

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst

accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new

problem threatens to earn them -- especially in America -- the sort of nasty headlines that

inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, lowlevel

IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking,

telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss's agenda in businesses of

every variety.

Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year – from organizations as

diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp

and even the University of California, Berkeley -- have left managers hurriedly peering into their

intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.

"Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset," says Haim

Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. "The ability to guard customer data is the

key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders". Indeed, just as

there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for

GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’s Columbia

Business School. "Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a

management issue, not a technical one," he says.

The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to

the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and

hugely expensive to restore -- and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company

letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.

The current state of affairs may have been encouraged -- though not justified -- by the lack of

legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law,

American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may

change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America,

disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’s

352

Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if

firms fail to provide adequate data security.

36. The statement “It never rains but it pours” is used to introduce

[A] the fierce business competition.

[B] the feeble boss-board relations.

[C] the threat from news reports.

[D] the severity of data leakage.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

一般文章开头的谚语都是用来引出文章的主要话题的。文章第一段的第二句话就进一步指出

了问题所在“Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst accounting and

compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens

to earn them -- especially in America -- the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads

rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity”（ 就在老板和董事会最终解决了令人头疼的财

务问题和违纪问题、改善了缺乏效率的公司管理之后，又一个新问题（尤其是在美国）将成

为令高层们头疼的头条新闻：数据的不安全性），即数据的不安全问题，第二段第一句话

“Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year”（今年，几起客户和员工

数据的重大泄密事件）则进一步作了说明，可见正确答案是D 选项。这句谚语的意思是“雨

不下则已，下则倾盆”。

[题目译文]

“It never rains but it pours”这句话用来介绍

[A] 激烈的商业竞争

[B] 脆弱的老板—董事关系

[C] 新报道的威胁

[D] 数据泄漏的严峻性

37. According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out

[A] whether there is any weak point.

[B] what sort of data has been stolen.

[C] who is responsible for the leakage.

353

[D] how the potential spies can be located.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第二段第二个破折号之后的内容“have left managers hurriedly peering into

their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities”（ 使得管

理人员们匆忙去检查其复杂的数据系统和商业流程，以便寻找潜在的弱点），原文的potential

vulnerabilities 对应于A 选项的weak point，因此是正确答案。B 和C 选项都与原文无关，D

选项中的spies 在文章中没有涉及。

[题目译文]

根据文章第二段，一些组织检查的它们的系统是为了发现

[A] 是否存在弱点

[B] 哪种数据被盗

[C] 谁应该为泄漏负责

[D] 如何定位可能的间谍

38. In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that

[A] shareholders’ interests should be properly attended to.

[B] information protection should be given due attention.

[C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.

[D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第三段的第三句话“Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted

Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security

Practices”（ 事实上，正如存在公认会计原则一样，现在或许应该是建立公认安全措施的

时候了），可见GASP 这个概念主要是用来提醒人们应该对信息保护给与更多关注，因此B

为正确选项。C 选项显然是与GAAP 这个概念混淆了，是错误答案。A 和D 选项对应于该

段第二句话“The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is

354

responsible for on behalf of shareholders”（ 保护客户数据的能力是市值的关键因素，这是董

事会应该为股东利益而承担的责任），但两个选项都与原文的表述有出入。

[题目译文]

作者引入GASP 这个概念是为了说明

[A] 股东的利益应该得到适当的关注

[B] 信息保护应该得到应有的重视

[C] 商业界应该改进他们的会计安全水准

[D] 客户数据的市场价值应该得到强调

39. According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to

[A] see the link between trust and data protection.

[B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data.

[C] realize the high cost of data restoration.

[D] appreciate the economic value of trust.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第四段，其中破折号后面的内容指出“and that few things are more likely to

destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands”（ 很少有

什么比一个公司让敏感的个人数据落入不法人员之手更可能破坏公司的诚信了），这里强调

了数据保护和公司信誉之间的密切关系，而很多老板们正是忽视了这层关系，因此正确答案

为A。而B、C、D 选项都只提到了data protection 和trust 中的一点，不具有概括性，因而

是错误答案。

[题目译文]

根据文章第四段，让作者感到意外的是一些老板们没有

[A] 看到诚信与数据保护之间的关系

[B] 看到个人数据的敏感性

[C] 意识到数据恢复的高成本

[D] 认识到诚信的经济价值

While still catching-up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way

ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing

depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda,

chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.

Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affects the

stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do

males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their

ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those

of the males.

Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities”

for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much

more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater

than men’s,” she observes, “It’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they

become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”

Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that

women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are

exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds

of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by,

unfortunately, parents or other family numbers, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wearand-

tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”

Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but wad determined to finish college.

“I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my

escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later her marriage ended and she became a

single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the

car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”

Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most

women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain.

Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it

threatens your health and your ability to function.

21. Which of the following is true according to the first two paragraphs?

[A] Women are biologically more vulnerable to stress.

[B] Women are still suffering much stress caused by men.

[C] Women are more experienced than men in coping with stress.

356

[D] Men and women show different inclinations when faced with stress.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在原文的前面两段，这两段主要描写男女因为生理上的差异，所以可能在相

同的情况下，女性可能更容易在压力下产生焦虑和沮丧。第一段首先提出了主要话题

“Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to

stress compared to men”（比起男人，妇女在压力下更加容易受到由于抑郁和焦虑而引起的

精神紊乱），而第二段进而开始分析原因，“Studies of both animals and humans have shown that

sex hormones somehow affects the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more

of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same conditions”（有关人类和动物的研究都表

明性激素在某种程度上会影响对于压力的反应，导致承受压力的雌性动物和女性人类相比雄

性动物和男性人类而言，在同等条件下更加容易产生引发以上病症的化学物质），由此可见

这种差异主要来自于男女在生理上的差异，因此正确选项为A。B 项和C 项不符合文意，B

项所指的女性遭受压力多来自男性偏离文章线索。C 项所说的女性相比男性更有处理压力的

经验也是断章取义。D 选项只是单纯描述男女之间在面对压力的差异，与中心偏离

[题目译文]

下面的哪一项符合文章的前两段？

[A] 妇女在生理上更容易受到压力的影响。

[B] 妇女仍然比男人受到更多压力的折磨

[C] 妇女比男人在应付压力方面更有经验

[D] 男人和女人在面对压力的时候显出了不同的倾向。

23. According to Paragraph 4, the stress women confront tends to be

[A] domestic and temporary.

[B] irregular and violent.

[C] durable and frequent.

[D] trivial and random.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

357

文章第四段谈到“I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of

a chronic or repeated nature”（我认为妇女平时要做的事情都是那些惯常的、重复的琐事），

相反，“Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random

physical violence”（男人则去打仗，他们面临的是格斗的压力。因而男人更多的是面对那种

随机性的身体接触上的暴力行为）。四个选项可以进行一一排除。A 选项的temporary 与原

文的chronic 矛盾，可以排除。B 选项是男人面对的压力的特点，因此也可以排除。D 选项

的random 与原文的repeated 矛盾，因此也可以排除。而C 选项符合原文“chronic or repeated”

的意思。

[题目译文]

根据文章第四段，女人们面对的压力往往是

[A] 关于家庭的和暂时的

[B] 不规律的和暴力的

[C] 持久的和频繁的

[D] 琐碎的和随机的

24. The sentence “I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”(Line 6, Para. 5) shows that

[A] Alvarez cared about nothing but making money.

[B] Alvarez’s salary barely covered her household expenses.

[C] Alvarez got paychecks from different jobs.

[D] Alvarez paid practically everything by check.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题应该把引文放到原文中去理解。题干中引文所在的这一段主要讲述了Alvarez 作为单身

母亲的不易，文中前面一句话是““It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay

the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt.”（最困难的事情就是我要同时带一个十几岁的

孩子、工作、付房租、付养车的开销、还要还债），说明她的生存压力非常大，只有B 选项

符合题意。这句话的意思是“我的生活就是付掉一张账单再付下一张”。

[题目译文]

“I lived from paycheck to paycheck”（第五段第六行）这个句子说明

[A] Alvarez 除了钱其它什么都不在乎。

[B] Alvarez 的工资几乎不够支付她的家庭支出

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory

would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the

authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review.

Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or

decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of

the results would have to subscribe to the journal.

No longer. The Internet–and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why

commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting

access to it- is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic

Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching

consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and

Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made

handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now,

been a key element of scientific endeavor.

The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in

part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core

scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The

International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are

more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than

1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.

This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals

are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main institutional

subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing

agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his

employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where

organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional

repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access,

where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making

359

it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form

of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.

26. In the first paragraph, the author discusses

[A] the background information of journal editing.

[B] the publication routine of laboratory reports.

[C] the relations of authors with journal publishers.

[D] the traditional process of journal publication.

[答案] B

本题对应于文章第一段。该段指出，“A journal editor would then remove the authors’

names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending

on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or

decline it”（这家刊物的编辑会抹去文章的作者和所在机构，然后把文章寄给这些研究人

员的同行们进行审阅。编辑会根据得到的审阅评论而决定是否发表这篇文章）。很明显，此

[B] It introduces an effective means of publication.

[C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers.

[D] It benefits scientific research considerably.

[答案] C

本题的对应信息在文章的第二段。该段第二句话指出“The Internet–and pressure from

funding agencies, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from

government-funded research by restricting access to it- is making access to scientific results a

reality”（网络——那些提供资金的机构也在施压，他们质疑为什么商业运作的刊物能够通

过限制政府投资的研究得到其资源而赚钱——使得阅读科学研究的成果变为现实），而下一

句话指出OECD 的报告正是关于这个内容的，因此A 选项不符合原文的意思，因为批评的

不是政府资助的研究，而是那些期刊。B 也选项与原文不符，可以排除。D 选项提高的内容

与该报告无关。C 选项则对应于该段第四句话“makes heavy reading for publishers who have,

so far, made handsome profits”（其内容使得那些到目前为止利润丰厚的出版商们都非常汗

颜），因此可见正确答案为C 选项。

[题目译文]

下面的哪一项正确地描述了OECD 的报告？

[A] 该报告批评了政府资助的研究。

[B] 该报告介绍了一种有效的出版方式。

[C] 该报告让以盈利为目的的刊物出版商们感到担忧。

[D] 该报告在很大程度上使得科学研究获益。

[A] cover the cost of its publication.

[B] subscribe to the journal publishing it.

[C] allow other online journals to use it freely.

[D] complete the peer-review before submission.

[答案] A

本题对应于最后一段的第三句话“There is open-access publishing, typically supported by

asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published”（第二种是开放式出

版模型，这种方式的典型特点就是要求作者（或其雇主）付钱发表文章），很显然A 选项

是正确答案。其他三个选项都与对应信息无关。

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National

Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however,

he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed

dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team

uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.

The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have

generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago,

today’s people- especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many

generations- apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get

any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty

much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright

State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from

the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.

Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients –

notably, protein – to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition

and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and

adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years,

a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention, average height- 5′9 〞for men, 5′4 〞for women- hasn’t really

changed since 1960.

Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During

childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even

though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle

with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs.

“There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual

organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.

362

Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon,

senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent

of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for

basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to

predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by

and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”

31. Wilt Chamberlain is cited as an example to

[A] illustrate the change of height of NBA players.

[B] show the popularity of NBA players in the U.S..

[C] compare different generations of NBA players.

[D] assess the achievements of famous NBA players.

[答案] A

[解题思路]

文章第一段主要谈论了美国NBA 运动员的身高在变高的趋势，该段最后一句话指出“The

bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and

managers have been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of

bigger, longer frames”（近几年那些身体状况起到主要作用的职业运动都经历了巨大的变化，

这些运动的经理人们都非常乐意重新裁制队服以适应球员们更高、更大的身材），显然正确

答案为A。B 和D 选项与该段内容无关，而C 选项的表述目的正是为了说明A，因此C 选

项也可以排除。

[题目译文]

Wilt Chamberlain 的例子用来

[A] 说明NBA 球员的身高变化

[B] 说明NBA 球员在美国很受欢迎

[C] 比较不同年代的NBA 球员

[D] 评估著名NBA 球员的成就

32. Which of the following plays a key role in body growth according to the text?

[A] Genetic modification.

[B] Natural environment.

363

[C] Living standards.

[D] Daily exercise.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章第三段，该段第二、三句话指出“At the start of the 20th century, undernutrition

and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children

and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20

years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height”（在20 世纪初的时候，营养不良和儿

童疾病影响了人们身体的长高。但是随着饮食和健康状况的改进，儿童和青少年比20 年前

平均长高了约一个半英寸，这就是众所周知的身高世俗趋势），可见最重要的因素还是生活

水平，因此正确答案为C。B 和D 选项在原文中没有提及，A 选项与文章最后一段的第一句

话“Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon”（基因的最大值可

以改变，但是不要期望它们会很快地改变）意思相反，也可以排除。

[题目译文]

根据文章，下面哪一项是身体长高的关键因素？

[A] 基因改变

[B] 自然环境

[C] 生活水平

[D] 日常锻炼

33. On which of the following statements would the author most probably agree?

[A] Non-Americans add to the average height of the nation.

[B] Human height is conditioned by the upright posture.

[C] Americans are the tallest on average in the world.

[D] Larger babies tend to become taller in adulthood.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可以采取排除法。A 选项的内容在原文中没有涉及，文章第二段只是谈到移民家庭的身

高达到了极限，因此A 选项可以首先排除。C 选项也是明显错误的，因为文章只是关注美

364

国人的身高问题，没有将其与全世界作比较。D 选项关于“large babies”在文章第四段中有

所涉及，但是文章只是谈到个子大的孩子通过产道顺利出生的困难更大，至于成人以后的情

况文章并没有提到。而B 选项对应于文章第四段的第三句话“Moreover, even though humans

have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with bipedal

posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs”（此外，尽管

人类直立行走已达百万年之久，我们的脚和背总是很费劲地保持两足姿势、而且很难抵挡过

大的身材带来的巨大压力）。因此B 为正确选项。

[题目译文]

作者会同意下面哪一项说法的观点？

[A] 非美国人的加入使得该国人口的平均身高变高

[B] 人类身高受到直立姿势的影响

[C] 美国人的平均身高在世界上是最高的

[D] 个子大的婴儿往往成人后也比其他人更高

**2008**年**Text 4**

In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington,

52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw- having

extracted them from the months of his slaves.

That’s far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember

from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles

slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by

DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had

fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have

scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral

compromises made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s

infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was

wrong and yet most did little to fight it.

More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of

their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also

understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped

to create.

For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was “like

having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George

365

Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have

signed the Constitution without protections for the “peculiar institution,” including a clause

that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.

And the statesmen’s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed

Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the

southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the

Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave

states.

Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children- though not Hemings herself or his

approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were

created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War,

overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will.

Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.

36. George Washington’s dental surgery is mentioned to

[A] show the primitive medical practice in the past.

[B] demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days.

[C] stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history.

[D] reveal some unknown aspect of his life.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

文章第一段是关于华盛顿换牙的例子，文章第二段随即指出“That’s far different image from

the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books. But

recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles slavery played in the lives of the

founding generation”（相比人们在历史书本中学到的那个坎樱桃树的乔治，这是一个截然

不同的形象。但是近来很多历史学家都开始关注奴隶制在美国开国的那一代人中所扮演的角

色），因此显然只有C 选项符合原文。A、B 选项可以比较容易地排除，而D 选项具有一定

的干扰性。这句话是对第二段第一句话的表面理解，但是不如C 选项更加具体和有针对性。

[题目译文]

乔治·华盛顿的牙科手术用来

[A] 说明过去的落后医术

[B] 说明在他的时候奴隶制的残酷

366

[C] 强调奴隶在美国历史中所扮演的角色

[D] 揭示他不为人知的一面

40. Washington’s decision to free slaves originated from his

[A] moral considerations.

[B] military experience.

[C] financial conditions.

[D] political stand.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章最后一段第二句话指出“Washington, who had begun to believe that all men

were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary

War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his

will”（华盛顿在目睹了黑人们在革命战争中的勇敢之后，开始相信所有人生来都是平等的，

于是他不顾亲戚的反对，坚持给予他的所有奴隶自由），很显然正确答案是B。

[题目译文]

华盛顿解放其奴隶的决定源自他的

[A] 道德考虑

[B] 军事经历

[C] 财政状况

[D] 政治立场

第六章、推理判断题命题思路透析

**Part I**、命题规律透析

推理判断题主要用来考查考生的推理和判断的能力。它与细节题不同，一般题干所

问的问题在阅读文章中没有直接且清晰的表述，因此不能在文章中找到现成的答案，而是要

根据文章提供的信息来进行推理。考生需要综合利用文章中提供的细节、事实并根据上下文

提供的线索进行逻辑分析，尤其要读透文章字里行间的含义，即透过表面认识本质，从而通

367

过自己的推理、判断和引申来得出正确的认识。推理判断题涉及的文章内容可能是一句话或

几句话、可能是一个或者两三个段落、甚至也可能是整篇文章。因此，推理判断题有较大的

难度，也是考生失分较多的地方。

但是，考生要记住的是，推理判断题考查的都是最简单的推理判断能力，不会涉及

到复杂的推理和判断。推理判断题的题干中一般都包含了若干标志性词汇，如suggest, imply,

infer, show, conclude, assume, learn, see 等，比较容易判断。在做题时，一个总的原则就是要

以原文的内容为依据，既不能原搬照抄原文的意思，也不能撇开原文的信息做空想的推理判

断。也就是说，做推理判断题的关键方法在于综合分析原文中提供的相关信息，在此基础上

进行paraphrase。

根据推理判断题的性质和出题范围，我们可以大致把这种题型分为三种类别：1、

局部推理题，即考查对于文章细节内容的判断能力，如上文所说，其对应的内容可以是文章

的一句话或几句话、抑或是一两个段落，是相对比较容易快速定位的推理题，题干中经常包

含了以下一些词汇，如the author believes that, the author implies that, according to the author

等。2、全文推理题，这种题型一般不是考查对于全文中心思想的推理，同样也是考查对细

节的推理，只不过是这些细节散布在文章的各个角落，需要考生进行全面的归纳，同时题干

中也经常包含了以下词汇， 如we can learn from the passage that, we can imply from the text

that 等。3、判断题，这种题型是细节题和推理题的综合，一般的问法为which of the following

is TURE，或者Which of the following is NOT true 等，即正向判断和反向判断两种方式，要

求考生找到符合原文信息的选项，而且四个选项所涉及的内容可能分布在文章各个段落，需

要考生迅速定位并进行推理判断。

推理判断题常见出题位置

1、文章的第一段和最后一段，以及每个段落的第一句话和最后一句话。

2、某个或者某些段落的主题句（可能不是该段落的首句和末句）。

3、文章中与中心思想关系密切的、起到重要支持作用的细节。

4、文章中表示起承转合的词汇：如but, however, on the contrary, yet, as a matter of fact, in fact,

actually, indeed, instead, nevertheless, nonetheless, whereas, by comparison, so, therefore 等。

5、文章中出现的特殊句型，如同位语、定语、状语、虚拟语气、插入语、不定式、分词、

各种从句如定语从句、宾语从句、同位语从句等。

6、文章中表示强调或递进关系的词语：如also, as well, even, indeed, even more, moreover,

furthermore, in addition, most … of all 等。

推理判断题正确答案选项的特点

1、正确答案一般其内容的含义比较丰富，更加具有综合性和概括性，尤其是当四个选项都

符合常识或者题目意思的时候，意义最丰富的那个选项往往是正确答案。

2、正确答案的表述一般有一点模糊，不会用绝对词汇，而会用一些相对能够留下一些余地

的词汇，如often, usually, sometimes, some, may, might, can, could, possibly, probably 等。

3、正确答案有的时候反而是与我们通过常识判断得出的结论是相反的。因此，如果四个选

项中有三个看上去与常识的判断相符，而余下的那一个却是反常识的，那么那个选项往往是

正确答案。

推理判断题干扰答案选项的特点

370

1、选项中意思虽然与原文相符，但是只是涉及一些细枝末节，不符合题干。

2、选项中出现表示绝对意义的词汇。

3、选项内容符合常识判断，但是却无法通过文章的内容推导出来。

4、选项内容与原文无关。

5、选项对文章内容作了张冠李戴的处理。

6、选项对文章内容作了偷换概念的处理，使用了与文章一样的词汇但是却改变了其含义。

7、选项将原文的逻辑关系作了颠倒处理，比如把因果关系中的因和果进行对调。

8、选项是对原文内容的简单重复，不是推理得出的结论。

9、选项的内容纯属主观臆断得出的结论，文章根本没有提及。

推理判断题解题方法

要做好推理判断题，要求考生能够充分理解阅读文章、分析语篇特征、寻找解题依

据。考生应该在领会全文的基础上作出正确的推理和判断。

􀂾 首先，要理解文章的字面意思，弄清上下文的整体逻辑；

􀂾 其次，在阅读过程中要注意作者遣词造句中的深层次含义；

􀂾 第三，要通读题干，充分了解题目要求我们进行推理和判断的内容，以免白费力气；

􀂾 最后，仔细挖掘作者隐藏在文章中的一些重要涵义，切勿用自己的主观判断来代替文章

内容。

同时，还要把握好以下几个推理原则：

􀁺 有的题目的推理即为原文具体层面的“同义变化”，也就是paraphrase。

􀁺 所涉及到的逻辑关系都是最简单的逻辑判断，一步即可推得，考生千万不能人为地

把问题复杂化，推理很多步，反而得出错误的答案。

􀁺 推理的基础是原文内容，而不是自己的经验和主观判断。

**Part II**、真题解题

**1993**年**Passage 1**

Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can

be starved and damaged? Judging from the drastic experiment of Frederick Ⅱ in the thirteenth

century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother

tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.

371

All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here.

What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life

especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.

Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are

still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the

signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If these sensitive

periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so

easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right time, but the process is slow and

hard once the critical stage has passed.

Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence and at a constant age, but

there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ.

At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months he can speak

simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three

to fifty words. At three he knows about l,000 words which he can put into sentences, and at four

his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.

Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about

man’s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to

connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern "toy-bear". And even more

incredible is the young brain’s ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound

around him, to analyse, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.

But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child ,

where the mother recognizes the signals in the child’ s babbling ( 咿呀学语) , grasping and

smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction

because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the

child’s non-verbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language.

34. Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage?

[A] The faculty of speech is inborn in man.

[B] Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in language learning.

[C] The child’s brain is highly selective.

[D] Most children learn their language in definite stages.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

372

本题应该与原文一一对应进行排除。A 选项对应于文章第五段第一句话“Recent evidence

suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak”（近来的一些证据显示，婴儿天生就

有说话能力），选项的表述与原文是一致的。C 选项对应于文章第五段最后一句话“And even

more incredible is the young brain’s ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of

sound around him, to analyse, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways”（更

加令人难以置信的是，婴儿的大脑能够从他听到的周围各种声音中找到语言的顺序，并且对

其进行分析，从而把这种语言以新的方式进行组合和重新组合），显然该选项也是正确的。

D 选项对应于文章文章第四段第一句话“Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a

fixed sequence and at a constant age”（专家们指出人们学习语言的阶段往往是通过一个固定

的进程、并且在一段时期内），而且第三、四两段主要就是围绕着D 选项的表述展开的。

因此这三个选项都不是答案。而B 选型“Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in

language learning”的意思是鼓励对孩子学习语言来说根本不需要。而文章中谈到这个问题

是在最后一段，讲的还是母亲的sensitive 与否对孩子在学习语言方面所取得的进步至关重

要。母亲的insensitivity 会使孩子有气馁感，而只会发出明显易于捕捉的信号，sensitivity（也

就是对孩子的信号有反馈进而encouragement）在孩子的语言发育和发展是至关重要的，因此

与B 的内容正相反，所以B 是本道题目的正确答案。

[题目译文]

下面的哪一项不能从文章中推断得出？

[A] 人类说话的能力是天生的

[B] 鼓励对于孩子们的语言学习来说是至关重要的

[C] 孩子的大脑有着高度的选择性

[D] 大多数孩子在特定的时期学会他们的语言

35. If a child starts to speak later than others, he will

[A] have a high IQ

[B] be less intelligent

[C] be insensitive to verbal signals

[D] not necessarily be backward

[答案] D

[解题思路]

373

文章第四段第一句话指出“Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence

and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually

turns out to be of high IQ”（专家们指出人们学习语言的阶段往往是通过一个固定的进程、

并且在一段时期内，但是却有一些特例，那些孩子们掌握语言能力的时期较晚，但最后却变

成了高智商的人）。这道题目假设的条件就是如果一个孩子比其他孩子说话说得迟，这个孩

子将来的情况可能是什么样子，根据第四段的第一句话，语言学习都有特定的顺序和时间性，

但是又有特殊情况，A 和B 与这句话的前后两个部分相矛盾，C 的内容与原文表述的内容

不符，原文中并没有提到孩子是否对事物(或信号)有不敏感的表现，而是提到他们的母亲在

他们学习语言的阶段所发出的非语言信号敏感与否，因此C 也不正确，只有D 最符合第四

段第一句话的表述，它包括两种可能性，即这个孩子有可能很迟钝，但是有可能又很聪明，

因此D 是本道题目的正确答案。

[题目译文]

如果一个孩子比其他孩子开始说话的时间晚，他会

[A] 有很高的智商

[B] 不那么聪明

[C] 对语言信号不敏感

[D] 不一定落后于其他人

**1993**年**Passage 2**

In general, our society is becoming one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic (官僚主

义的) management in which man becomes a small , well-oiled cog in the machinery. The oiling is

done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped music, and by psychologists and

"human-relations" experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become powerless,

that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and that he is bored with it. In fact, the

blue-and the white-collar workers have become economic puppets who dance to the tune of

automated machines and bureaucratic management.

The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might find themselves out of a job;

they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest in life.

They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental realities of human existence as

emotionally and intellectually independent and productive human beings.

Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their lives are no less empty than

those of their subordinates. They are even more insecure in some respects. They are in a highly

competitive race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary but even more a matter

374

of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are tested for intelligence as well as for the

tight mixture of submissiveness and independence. From that moment on they are tested again and

again-by the psychologists, for whom testing is a big business, and by their superiors, who judge

their behavior, sociability, capacity to get along, etc. This constant need to prove that one is as

good as or better than one’ s fellow-competitor creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes

of unhappiness and illness.

Am I suggesting that we should return to the preindustrial mode of production or to nineteenthcentury

"free enterprise" capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never solved by returning to a

stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming our social system from a

bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and consumption are ends in

themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full development of his potentialitiesthose

of love and of reason-are the aims of all social arrangements. Production and consumption

should serve only as means to this end, and should be prevented from ruling man.

38. From the passage we can infer that real happiness of life belongs to those

[A] who are at the bottom of the society

[B] who are higher up in their social status

[C] who prove better than their fellow-competitors

[D] who could keep far away from this competitive world

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题可以采取排除法。文章第二段谈到一般的工人和职员的焦虑，第三段则是关于社会高层

的人的焦虑，可见他们都不拥有真正的幸福，可以排除A 和B 选项。而选项与文章第三段

的最后一句话矛盾“This constant need to prove that one is as good as or better than one’ s

fellow-competitor creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes of unhappiness and illness”

（他们需要不断地证明自己与竞争对手同样优秀或者超过对手，从而不断地产生忧虑和压力，

这正是不幸疾病的起因），正是因为竞争才使得他们焦虑，因此C 选项也可以排除。而D

选项正好从反面来理解这句话，既然竞争带来忧虑，那么远离竞就可以使人们获得幸福生活。

[题目译文]

从文中我们可以推断真正的幸福属于那些

[A] 处于社会底层的人

[B] 社会地位较高的人

375

[C] 证明自己比其他竞争者强的人

[D] 能够远离竞争世界的人

39. To solve the present social problems the author suggests that we should

[A] resort to the production mode of our ancestors

[B] offer higher wages to the workers and employees

[C] enable man to fully develop his potentialities

[D] take the fundamental realities for granted

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题也可以采用排除法。A 选项对应于最后一段的前两句话“Am I suggesting that we should

return to the preindustrial mode of production or to nineteenth-century "free enterprise" capitalism?

Certainly not”（我是否在建议我们应回到工业化前的生产模式或回到十九世纪“自由企业”

资本主义时期呢？当然不是），显然选项的表述与原文相反，可以排除。而B 和D 选项都

不是作者提到的解决方案。作者的提议是“I suggest transforming our social system from a

bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and consumption are ends in

themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full development of his potentialitiesthose

of love and of reason-are the aims of all social arrangements”（我建议把我们的社会制度

从以最大限度生产和最大限度消费为目的的官僚主义管理工业体制变成一个充分发挥人的

潜能——如爱和理性的潜能——为目的的人道主义工业体制），C 选项对应于作者提出的

“full development of his potentialities”，因而是正确选项。

[题目译文]

为了解决当前的社会问题，作者建议我们应该

[A] 回到我们祖先的生产模式

[B] 给工人和雇员们提供高工资

[C] 帮助人们充分发展他们的潜能

[D] 接受这些根本的现实

**1993**年**Passage 3**

376

When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him: he

can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.

A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by which the

inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention to the

public after that period terminates. Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a

patent extended to alter this normal process of events.

The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV

receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent’ s normal life there was

no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention.

Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the library

attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that are free for anyone to

use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent experts often advise

anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a search through live patents that the one sure

way of avoiding violation of any other inventor’ s right is to plagiarize a dead patent. Likewise,

because publication of an idea in any other form permanently invalidates further patents on that

idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern technological

advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.

Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most "new" ideas are, in fact,

as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or

dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. The basic

patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original ideas behind

television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine

car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the rear.

45. From the passage we learn that

[A] an invention will not benefit the inventor unless it is reduced to commercial practice

[B] products are actually inventions which were made a long time ago

[C]. it is much cheaper to buy an old patent than a new one

[D] patent experts often recommend patents to others by conducting a search through dead patents

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题可以采用排除法。B 选项的说法无中生有，可以首先排除。C 选项也是错误的，因为文

章没有提到新老专利是否价格相同，只是推荐人们买过期专利。D 选项对应于文章第四段的

377

第二句话“Indeed, patent experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of

conducting a search through live patents that the one sure way of avoiding violation of any other

inventor’ s right is to plagiarize a dead patent”（实际上，专利专家们常对希望开发有效专利

而又想避免高额费用的人提出建议，即避免侵犯他人专利权的有效方法就是使用过期专利），

这个建议只是向那些“anyone wishing to avoid the high cost”的人的建议，选项表述与原文

不符。而A 选项对应于最后一段的第二句话“It is their reduction to commercial practice, either

through necessity or dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news

and money”（只有把握时代的需求，锐意进取，跟上新技术的步伐，专利才能变成商业实

践，从而实现名利双收），反过来说还在商用之前专利不能使发明者受益，因此A 选型符

合文章意思。

[题目译文]

从文中我们可以了解到

[A] 一项发明在进入商业用途之前是不能使发明者受益的

[B] 所有的产品在很长时间以前实际上都是发明

[C] 购买老专利比购买新专利便宜得多

[D] 专利专家们经常向人们推荐使用已经过期的专利

**1994**年**Passage 1**

The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, marketoriented

economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their

money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen,

striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen;

and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods

and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual

consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of

individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how

resources are used to produce it.

An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer

demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this

mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to

relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short

supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated

from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost,

378

this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price

and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the

American economic system.

The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own

productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over

natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy,

the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also

certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract

with another private individual.

53. According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is characterized by__.

[A] private property and rights concerned

[B] manpower and natural resources control

[C] ownership of productive resources

[D] free contracts and prices

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本文第三段第一句话指出“The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that

individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private property) , and they are permitted to

hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit”

（私有企业经济的一个重要因素是允许个人拥有生产资料（私有财产），允许他们雇佣劳动

力，控制自然资源，通过生产产品、提供服务来获取利润），第二句话进一步指出“In the

American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of

productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product

or to make a free contract with another private individual”（在美国经济中，私有财产的概念不

仅包括生产资料的所有权，也包括一定的其它权利，比如，产品价格的决定权或与其他私有

个体的自由签约权），这说明了private property 包含了两个方面。而四个选项中只有A 选

项包含了这两个方面，因此A 是正确答案。

[题目译文]

根据这篇文章，私有企业经济的特征是。

[A] 私有财产和相关的权利

[B] 人力和自然资源的控制

379

[C] 生产资料所有权

[D] 自由合同与价格

**1994**年**Passage 2**

One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They

give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country,

and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these

credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in

scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the "cashless

society" is not on the horizon—it’s already here.

While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers

too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide

range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows

businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold and how

fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the

same time these computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the most

efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also

identify preferred customers for promotional campaigns. Computers are relied on by

manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which

products to emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep

track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.

Numerous other commercial enterprise, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and

electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to consumers through

the use of computers.

56. From the last sentence of the first paragraph we learn that __.

[A] in the future all the Americans will use credit cards

[B] credit cards are mainly used in the United States today

[C] nowadays many Americans do not pay in cash

[D] it is now more convenient to use credit cards than before

[答案] C

[解题思路]

第一段最后一句话指出“For many of us the "cashless society" is not on the horizon—it’s already

here”（ 对于我们很多人来说，“无现钞的社会”不是即将来临，而是已经到来），其中cashless

society 正好对应于C 选项的do not pay in cash，因此C 为正确选项。A 选项对未来情况的描

述并没有出现在文章中，原文说的是现在的情况，因此可以排除该选项。B 选项的表述显然

不正确，信用卡除了在美国使用之外也在世界很多国家广泛使用。D 选项则与原文的句子无

关。

从文章第一段的最后一句话中，我们了解到。

[A] 将来所有的美国人都会用信用卡

[B] 信用卡现在主要用于美国

[C] 现在很多美国人不用现金付款

[D] 现在用信用卡比以前更加方便

**1994**年**Passage 3**

Exceptional children are different in some significant way from others of the same age. For

these children to develop to their full adult potential, their education must be adapted to those

differences.

Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find ourselves describing their

environment as well. While the leading actor on the stage captures our attention, we are aware of

the importance of the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both the family and the

society in which exceptional children live are often the key to their growth and development. And

it is in the public schools that we find the full expression of society’ s understanding—the

knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the next generation.

Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that minor we can see the strengths, the

weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and the central values of the culture itself. The great

interest in exceptional children shown in public education over the past three decades indicates the

strong feeling in our society that all citizens, whatever their special conditions, deserve the

opportunity to fully develop their capabilities.

"All men are created equal.” We’ve heard it many times, but it still has important meaning for

education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used by this country’s founders to

denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to mean equality of opportunity. That

concept implies educational opportunity for all children-the right of each child to receive help in

learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that capacity be small or great. Recent court

381

decisions have confirmed the right of all children-disabled or not-to an appropriate education, and

have ordered that public schools take the necessary steps to provide that education. In response,

schools are modifying their programs, adapting instruction to children who are exceptional, to

those who cannot profit substantially from regular programs.

62. From this passage we learn that the educational concern for exceptional children ___.

[A] is now enjoying legal support

[B] disagrees with the tradition of the country

[C] was clearly stated by the country` s founders

[D] will exert great influence over court decisions

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章最后一段，其中倒数第二句话指出“Recent court decisions have confirmed the

right of all children-disabled or not-to an appropriate education, and have ordered that public

schools take the necessary steps to provide that education”（最近的法庭裁决已再次确定了所有

儿童——不论残疾与否——都有接受相适应的教育的权利，并已命令公立学校采取必要的措

施来提供这种教育），因此A 选项符合题意。该段中第三、四句话指出“Although the phrase was

used by this country’s founders to denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to

mean equality of opportunity. That concept implies educational opportunity for all children-the

right of each child to receive help in learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that

capacity be small or great”（尽管这句话被国家缔造者们用来预示法律面前人人平等，它也

被解释为机会面前人人平等。这一概念暗示了所有儿童都有接受教育的机会——即每个儿

童，不管其本身的能力大小与否，都有权利在学习上最大限度地得到帮助），因此对特殊儿

童的教育关注是符合这个国家的“机会平等的传统”的，因此B 选项是错误的。C 选项的

错误在于开国元勋们并没有提到这个问题。D 则不符合倒数第二句话的意思。

[题目译文]

从这篇文章中我们了解到，对特殊儿童的教育关于。

[A] 现在得到了法律上的支持

[B] 与国家的传统相背离

[C] 早在建国初期先驱们就已有明确表述

[D] 将会给法庭的决定带来影响

382

**1994**年**Passage 5**

Discoveries in science and technology are thought by "untaught minds" to come in blinding

flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have

it, look at the mold (霉) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He

experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his discovery.

Inventions and innovations almost always come out of laborious trial and error. Innovation is like

soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently

than they score.

The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal—and

so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between innovation and

others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on theirs, and

they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise. What ordinary people see as

fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid possibilities.

“Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there’s no particular virtue in doing

things the way they have always been done,” wrote Rudolph Flexh, a language authority, this

accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and suitcases

on wheels that make life more convenient : "How come nobody thought of that before?” The

creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as it appears. Innovators will not

accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average

person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route. The innovator

will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the long run and are bound to be more

interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends.

Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.

70. The phrase “march to a different drummer” (the last line of the passage) suggests that highly

creative individuals are__.

[A] diligent in pursuing their goals

[B] reluctant to follow common ways of doing things

[C] devoted to the progress of science

[D] concerned about the advance of society

[答案] B

[解题思路]

383

题干的词组来自文章最后一句“Highly creative individuals really do march to a different

drummer”，这句话是对全文的精确总结，也是对第四段的承接。第四段的最后一句话谈到

“The innovator will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the long run and are

bound to be more interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends”（创新者则会探寻

另外不同的道路，而这样的道路将会最终被证实更简单、也一定更有趣、更富挑战性，即使

它们通向绝境），也就是说，innovators 即那些highly creative individuals 都不愿意循规蹈矩，

而更愿意开拓新的方法，可见B 选项为正确答案。文章最后一句话的意思是“极富创造性

的人的确是打着不同的鼓点前进的”。

[题目译文]

“march to a different drummer”这个词组（文章最后一句话）暗示了那些非常具有创造力的人

们。

[A] 勤奋地追求着他们的目标

[B] 不愿意用普通的方式做事情

[C] 献身给了科学进步

[D] 关心社会的前进

**1995**年**Passage 3**

In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become

complicated. Many of life’ s problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or

colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert

information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people

today.

In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War Ⅱ. As families

move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family

relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that

information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost

unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things

once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be

consciously learned.

Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now

has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one piece of

information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated , time-consuming and

sometimes even overwhelming .

384

Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which

enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has

ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in

machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information.

Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very

shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended

the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared

world wide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the

participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has

facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making

more information available to more people.

In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance.

Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems,

the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed.

"Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most

critical requirement of all people.

61. From the passage we can infer that__.

[A]electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting messages

[B] it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an information era

[C]people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences

[D] events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本文可将选项与原文一一对应进行排除。首先B 选项的相关内容在原文中没有提及，属于

干扰选项，可以排除。C 选项对应于原文第四段第五句话“Expertise can be shared world wide

through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving

their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site”（人们通过电话会议就可以分享专

业知识，会议参与者们不需要离开自己的住所或者工作岗位去遥远的会场就可以讨论和解决

存在争议的问题），可见减少的时间是去参加会议的旅途时间，而不是开会时间本身，因此

C 选项也是错误答案。D 选项对应于第四段第四句话“Satellites have extended the power of

communications to report events at the instant of occurrence”（人造卫星进一步发展了通信能

力，可以对各个事件进行现场报道），文章指出卫星可以提高现场直播的能力，但D 选项

385

将原文的表述倒过来讲，现场直播是否主要通过卫星进行就不得而知了，因此D 选项也是

错误答案。A 选项对应于第四段第三句话“Telecommunications developments enable the

sending of messages via television, radio, and very shortly, electronic mail to bombard people

with multitudes of messages”（电信技术的发展使得电视和无线电发送信息，而且很快电子

邮件会不断地给人们送来大量的信息），选项表述符合原文，因此是正确答案。

[题目译文]

从文中我们可以推断。

[A] 电子邮件很快就会在信息传输中扮演主导角色

[B] 在信息时代人们想要保密会更加困难

[C] 人们会化更少的时间开会

[D] 各种事件都会通过卫星进行现场直播

62. We can learn from the last paragraph that __.

[A] it is necessary to obtain as much

[B] people should make the best use of the information

[C] we should realize the importance of accumulating information .

[D] it is of vital importance to acquire needed information efficiently

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应于原文最后一段，该段第一句指出“In this world of change and complexity, the need

for information is of greatest importance”（在这个复杂和多边的世界中，对于信息的需求是

至关重要的），同时最后一句进一步总结道“"Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying

and access to information may be the most critical requirement of all people”（“知识就是力量”

这句谚语最正确不过，获取信息也许对于所有人来说是最迫切的要求了），可见最重要的是

如何有效地获取所需信息，因此D 为正确选项。A 选项明显错误，因为问题关键不在于获

取尽可能多的信息，而是如何获得信息。B 选项表述与原文无关。C 选项强调积累信息的重

要性，也与原文无关。

[题目译文]

我们可以从最后一段中了解到。

[A] 有必要得到尽可能多的信息

386

[B] 人们应该充分利用信息

[C] 我们应该实现积累信息的重要性

[D] 有效地取得有用的信息是非常重要的

**1995**年**Passage 4**

Personality is to a large extent inherent--A-type parents usually bring about A-type offspring.

But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if competition is important to the

parents, it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.

One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a

highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the ‘win at all costs’ moral standard and

measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children compete

against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer system , in which competitive

A-types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have

dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the first marathon runner, dropped dead

seconds after saying: “Rejoice, we conquer!”

By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate emphasis on

examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The

merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in the certain

knowledge of failure is positively harmful.

Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A-youngsters change into B’s. The world

needs A types, and schools have an important duty to try to fit a child’s personality to his possible

future employment. It is top management.

If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, more time might be spent

teaching children surer values. Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially medicine,

could be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as sensitivity

and sympathy. It is surely a mistake to choose our doctors exclusively from A-type stock. B’s are

important and should be encouraged.

66. From the passage we can draw the conclusion that__.

[A] the personality of a child is well established at birth

[B] family influence dominates the shaping of one` s characteristics .

[C] the development of one` s personality is due to multiple factors

[D] B-type characteristics can find no place in competitive society

387

[答案] C

[解题思路]

文章第一段的两句“Personality is to a large extent inherent--A-type parents usually bring about

A-type offspring. But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if competition is

important to the parents, it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children”（性格

在很大程度上是与生俱来的——A 型的父母通常会有A 型性格的后代。但是环境也有着深远

的影响，因为如果竞争对于父母来说很重要的话，那么竞争也有可能成为孩子生活中的一个

重要因素）从两个方面指出了性格的成因，即天生和后天环境的影响。A、B 选项都只涉及

其中一个方面，应首先排除。C 选项很好地概括了原文的要点，是正确答案。而D 选项则

并不是本文讨论的重点。

[题目译文]

从最后一段我们可以得出以下结论。

[A] 儿童的性格在出生的时候就已经形成了

[B] 家庭的影响对于一个人性格的形成起到了主要的作用

[C] 一个人性格的发展取决于很多因素

[D] B 型性格的人在现在竞争社会中将无法找到立足之地

**1995**年**Passage 5**

That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an obvious but nevertheless

remarkable activity called remembering. Learning could not occur without the function popularly

named memory. Constant practice has such as effect on memory as to lead to skillful performance

on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and understanding these words. Socalled

intelligent behaviour demands memory, remembering being a primary requirement for

reasoning. The ability to solve any problem or even to recognize that a problem exists depends on

memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street is based on remembering many earlier

experiences.

Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task or for any learned material.

Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and the adaptive

consequences may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting can seem to be

adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be intffpreted to have survived through a process

of natural selection in animals. Indeed, when one’s memory of an emotionally painful experience

lead to serious anxiety, forgetting may produce relief. Nevertheless, an evolutionary interpretation

388

might make it difficult to understand how the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived

natural selection.

In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its possible aspects, it is helpful to

consider what would happen if memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids orientation in time,

since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing clues for inferring duration.

Without forgetting, adaptive ability would suffer, for example, learned behaviour that might have

been correct a decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of people who (by ordinary

standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were full of confusion. This forgetting

seems to serve that survival of the individual and the species.

Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited capacity that provides

adaptive flexibility specifically through forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are made

between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). Indeed, there is evidence that

the rate at which individuals forget is directly related to how much they have learned. Such data

offers gross support of contemporary models of memory that assume an input-output balance.

69. From the last paragraph we know that__.

[A] forgetfulness is a response to learning

[B] the memory storage system is an exactly balanced input-output system

[C] memory is a compensation for forgetting

[D] the capacity of a memory storage system is limited because forgetting occurs

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章最后一段。B 选项对应于该段最后一句话“In this view, continual adjustments

are made between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output)”（这些数据为当代

的这种记忆输入--输出平衡模型提供了有力的支持），但选项中exactly 这个词并不符合原文

意思，因此B 为错误选项。C 选项对应于该段第一句话“Another line of thought assumes a

memory storage system of limited capacity that provides adaptive flexibility specifically through

forgetting”（另一种思路认为，容量有限的记忆储存系统通过遗忘来提供适应的灵活性），

但选项的内容正好与原文相反，而D 选项则颠倒了这句的因果关系，因此两个选项都可以

排除。A 选项的表述则正好反映了第一句话的内容，因而是正确答案。

[题目译文]

从最后一段中我们可以了解到。

389

[A] 遗忘是对学习的一种反应

[B] 记忆存储系统是一个精确平衡的输入—输出系统

[C] 记忆是对于遗忘的补偿

[D] 记忆存储系统由于遗忘的发生而功能有限

**1996**年**Passage 4**

What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early America-breakthroughs such

as the telegraph , the steamboat and the weaving machine?

Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country’s excellent elementary schools;

a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums to inventors;

and above all the American genius for nonverbal , “spatial” thinking about things technological .

Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools our early mechanics

,especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, were generally literate and at home in

arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.

Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and inventiveness to this educational

advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 1853 reported, “With a mind

prepared by thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly into the skilled

workman.”

A further stimulus to invention came from the “premium” system, which preceded our patent

system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, originated abroad, offered inventors

medals, cash prizes and other incentives.

In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were awarded at country fairs and

at the industrial fairs in major cities. Americans flocked to these fairs to admire the new machines

and thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance.

Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the American worker took readily

to that special kind of nonverbal thinking required in mechanical technology. As Eugene Ferguson

has pointed out , “A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be reduced to unambiguous

verbal descriptions; they are dealt with in his mind by a visual, nonverbal process . . . The designer

and the inventor . . . are able to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices that as yet do not

exist.”

This nonverbal “spatial” thinking can be just as creative as painting and writing. Robert Fulton

once wrote, “The mechanic should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels, etc., like a

poet among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, in which

a new arrangement transmits a new idea.”

390

When all these shaping forces--schools, open attitudes, the premium system, a genius for spatial

thinking--interacted with one another on the rich U. S. mainland, they produced that American

characteristic, emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But in earlier times it meant a

friendly but competitive striving for fame and excellence.

64. It is implied that adaptiveness and inventiveness of the early American mechanics__

[A] benefited a lot from their mathematical knowledge

[B] shed light on disciplined school management

[C] was brought about by privileged home training

[D] owed a lot to the technological development

[答案] A

[解题思路]

文章第四段第一句话指出“Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and

inventiveness to this educational advantage”（在目光敏锐的外国观察家眼里，美国人的适应

能力和创新能力与这种教育优势是分不开的），而这里所指的“educational advantage”就是

第三段最后一句中指出的“arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry”（精

通算术、并且了解一些几何和三角），因此可以推断正确答案为A。其他三个选项都不确切

地符合原文的意思。

[题目译文]

从文中可以推断，早期美国机械工的适应能力和创新能力。

[A] 极大地得益于他们的数学知识

[B] 清楚地显示出严格的学校管理

**1996**年**Passage 5**

Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in the publisher’s pipelines.

A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused and often

unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific theories for the origin and

evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and biology have provided a consistent ,

unified, and constantly improving account of what happened. "Scientific" creationism, which is

391

being pushed by some for “equal time” in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of

evolution are evil, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all scientists and the majority of

nonfunda mentalist religious leaders have come to regard “scientific” creationism as bad science

and bad religion.

The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At

appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. In the last

three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He describes their

programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the extent of their

deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is

religious, one might have expected more Christian behavior.

Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness of his

arguments. The nonspecialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and

argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the creationists will be extremely

clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen Jay Gould says: “This book stands for

reason itself.” And so it does-and all would be well were reason the only judge in the

creationism/evolution debate.

69 From the passage we can infer that__

[A] reasoning has played a decisive role in the debate

[B] creationists do not base their argument on reasoning

[C] evolutionary theory is too difficult for non-specialists

[D] creationism is supported by scientific findings

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息在文章最后一段，该段最后一句话指出“And so it does-and all would be well

were reason the only judge in the creationism/evolution debate”（ 的确如此——如果理性是创

世纪论和进化论之争的惟一评判标准，那么一切问题就迎刃而解），A 选项显然与原句不符，

因为原文只是假设理性起评判标准的作用，但事实并非如此。根据文章最后一句的意思，推

断应该决定这番辩论中哪一方是正确的，而作者的态度一直都是反对创世纪论，因此可以推

断creationism 不是以理性为基础，B 是正确选项。C 选项与最后一句第二句话“The

nonspecialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and argument that support

evolutionary theory”（非专业人士至少可以了解支持进化论的各种数据和观点）的意思不符，

可以排除。D 选项明显与原文观点违背，是错误选项。

392

[题目译文]

从文中我们可以推断。

[A] 逻辑推理在辩论中发挥了决定性的作用。

[B] 创世纪论的观点不是基于逻辑推理

[C] 进化论对于非专业人士来说太难了

[D] 创世纪论者得到了科学发现的支持

**1997**年**Passage 1**

It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing and

final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia’s Northern Territory became the first legal

authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die.

The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the

Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to

Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group’s on line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess:

“We posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn’t just something that happened in

Australia. It’s world history.”

The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally III law has left

physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have

breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right to life groups and the Australian Medical

Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn

back. In Australia — where an aging population, life extending technology and changing

community attitudes have all played their part — other states are going to consider making a

similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US and Canada, where the right to die movement is

gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling.

Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death — probably by a

deadly injection or pill — to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally

ill by two doctors. After a “cooling off” period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of

request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54 year old Darwin

resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally III law means he can get on with

living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition.

“I’m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I’d go,

because I’ve watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,”

he says.

393

51. From the second paragraph we learn that _____.

[A] the objection to euthanasia is slow to come in other countries

[B] physicians and citizens share the same view on euthanasia

[C] changing technology is chiefly responsible for the hasty passage of the law

[D] it takes time to realize the significance of the law’s passage

[答案] D

[解题思路]

文章第二段第一句话指出“The full import may take a while to sink in”，下一句话进一步指

出不论是医生还是普通市民都要“trying to deal with its moral and practical implications”（力

图从道义和实际意义两方面来看待这一问题），接下来还提到对这个法案还有很多反对意见，

因此D 选项符合题意，即人们还需要时间来认识这项法律的重要性。选项中takes time 对应

于该句的take a while，realize 对应于sink in，而significance 对应于full import。A 选项的表

述在原文没有提及。B 选项的错误在于该段第二句虽然提到了“physicians and citizens”，

但是却没有说他们意见一致。C 选项的错误在于该段第三句批评了该法案的“the haste of

passage”，但并无涉及关于科技发展的问题。

[题目译文]

从第二段我们可以得知。

[A] 其它国家对安乐死的反对出现比较慢

[B] 医生和市民们对安乐死持相同观点

[C] 变化的技术对于这些法案的草率通过负主要责任

[D] 认识到这一法律的意义需要时间

**1997**年**Passage 2**

A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly, courteous, and helpful

most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and

Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small

minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it

is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment.

For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in

an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who

394

generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of

diversion, and brought news of the outside world.

The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling

alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin or settlement.

It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable impulse on the part of the

settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: if you didn’t take in the stranger and take care of

him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same

situation.

Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the weary traveler.

Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the

smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. “I was just traveling through, got

talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner — amazing.” Such

observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood

properly. The casual friendliness of many Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial

nor as artificial, but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition.

As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals, assumptions,

and conventions underlies all social interrelationships. And, of course, speaking a language does

not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. Visitors who fail to

“translate” cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example, when an

American uses the word “friend”, the cultural implications of the word may be quite different

from those it has in the visitor’s language and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a

bus to distinguish between courteous convention and individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a

virtue that many American value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers.

56. It could be inferred from the last paragraph that _____.

[A] culture exercises an influence over social interrelationship

[B] courteous convention and individual interest are interrelated

[C] various virtues manifest themselves exclusively among friends

[D] social interrelationships equal the complex set of cultural conventions

[答案] A

[解题思路]

最后一段第一句话指出“As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of

cultural signals, assumptions, and conventions underlies all social interrelationships”（同任何发

395

达国家一样，美国人所有的社会交往的基础是一整套复杂的文化特征，信念和习俗），因此

A 符合题意，为正确答案。B 选项的错误在于，虽然倒数第二句话提到了“It takes more than a

brief encounter on a bus to distinguish between courteous convention and individual interest”（要

想分清称呼“朋友”是出于好客的文化习俗还是出于个人兴趣，只靠在公共汽车上的萍水相

逢是不够的），但是却没有提及courteous convention 和individual interest 之间的关系。C 选

项“exclusively”显然与文中描述的美国人对陌生人的热情这一事实不符，文章最后一句也

提到“Yet, being friendly is a virtue that many American value highly and expect from both

neighbors and strangers”（然而，友好是很多美国人推崇备至的美德，同时他们也希望自己

的邻居和陌生人也能够如此）。D 选项与该段第一句话的意思有出入，social interrelationships

与the complex set of cultural conventions 之间并不是平等（equal）的关系。

[题目译文]

从最后一段可以推断。

[A] 文化对于社会相互关系有一定的影响力

[B] 表示客气的传统和个人兴趣是相关的

[C] 各种美德只是在朋友之间才表现出来

[D] 社会间的相互关系等同于复杂的文化传统

**1997**年**Passage 3**

Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or mental functioning is a drug.

Many people mistakenly believe the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine or an illegal

chemical taken by drug addicts. They don’t realize that familiar substances such as alcohol and

tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is now used by many

physicians and psychologists. The phrase “substance abuse” is often used instead of “drug abuse”

to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as harmfully misused as

heroin and cocaine.

We live a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances (drugs) is pervasive: an

aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a

cigarette for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently constructive uses of a

substance become misuses? First of all, most substances taken in excess will produce negative

effects such as poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a substance can also

lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence is marked first by an increased

tolerance, with more and more of the substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by

the appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued.

396

Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and

behavior are known as psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are commonly grouped

according to whether they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants initially speed

up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants slow it down. Hallucinogens have

their primary effect on perception, distorting and altering it in a variety of ways including

producing hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic (from the Greek word

meaning “mind-manifesting”) because they seemed to radically alter one’s state of consciousness.

62. From the last paragraph we can infer that _____.

[A] stimulants function positively on the mind

[B] hallucinogens are in themselves harmful to health

[C] depressants are the worst type of psychoactive substances

[D] the three types of psychoactive substances are commonly used in groups

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题应将选项与最后一段一一对应排除。A 选项对应于第三句话“Stimulants initially speed up

or activate the central nervous system”（兴奋剂主要起到加速或激活中枢神经系统活动的作

用），但选项中认为“对于头脑有积极的作用”这一点在原文没有提及。C 选项显然是错误

的，因为文中没有提到这三种物质中哪一种是worst。D 选项的说法则在原文也没有涉及到。

而B 选项对应于倒数第二句话“Hallucinogens have their primary effect on perception, distorting

and altering it in a variety of ways including producing hallucinations”（幻觉剂主要影响人的感

知，通过各种不同的方式对感知加以扭曲或改变，其中包括产生幻觉。这些物质常被认为能

“引起幻觉”），说明hallucinogen 本身就有害于健康，因此B 选项符合原文，是正确答案。

[题目译文]

从最后一段我们可以推断。

[A] 兴奋剂对于头脑有积极的作用

[B] 幻觉剂本身就对身体有害

[C] 镇静剂是心理活性物质中最差的一种

[D] 三种心理活性物质通常都一起使用

**1997**年**Passage 5**

397

Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as “steering the economy to a soft

landing” or “a touch on the brakes”, makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could be

further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain. And there are long,

variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the analogy that

likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear

view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.

Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of late.

Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its

lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way below the

double digit rates which many countries experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s.

It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists which

The Economist polls each month said that America’s inflation rate would average 3.5% in 1995.

In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and expected to average only about 3% for the year as a whole.

In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end

of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, inflation has been

consistently lower than expected in Britain and America.

Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and the

United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially America’s,

have little productive slack. America’s capacity utilization, for example, his historically high

levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen bellow most estimates of

the natural rate of unemployment — the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past.

Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a little

defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have up ended the

old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation.

67. From the passage we learn that ____.

[A] there is a definite relationship between inflation and interest rates

[B]) economy will always follow certain models

[C] the economic situation is better than expected

[D] economists had foreseen the present economic situation

[答案] C

[解题思路]

398

本题可以将选项一一排除。首先，第一段第三句话指出“The link between interest rates and

inflation is uncertain”（利率和通货膨胀之间的关系并不是确定的），因此A 选项与原文相

反，可以排除。B 选项与文章最后的“powerful structural changes in the world have up ended the

old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation”（世

界经济结构强有力的变化已经打破了那个以经济增长和通货膨胀的原有关联为基础的旧有

经济模式）的意思相反，也是错误选项。D 选项则与文章第四段第一句话“Economists have

been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and the United States”（尤其

让经济学家感到惊讶的是，英美两国的通胀率带来了良性的结果）的意思相反，说明目前的

情况科学家们也没有预测到，因此C 选项也可以排除。而C 选项正好符合这一句话隐含的

意思，即实际的经济情况比预测的要好。

[题目译文]

从文中我们可以了解到。

[A] 通货膨胀和利率之间有确定的关系

[B] 经济将总会遵循一定的模式

[C] 经济状况比预期的要好

[D] 经济学家预测到了目前的经济状况

**1998**年**Passage 1**

Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is

humankind’s long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the ideal of forcing the

waters to do our bidding so fascination. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind.

Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good.

The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn’t help that building a big,

powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to assert

themselves. Egypt’s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam.

Turkey’s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.

But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example stopped the Nile

flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left - all in return for a giant reservoir of

disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.

And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized Europe,

Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam

on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of big dams. But

Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs a dam to prove itself.

399

Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go ahead to the even more wrong headed

Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will cause

hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the powerful, but

they are far from guaranteed.

Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of controlling water

can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are

possible without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it is hard to be

either proper, or scientific. It is time that the world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don’t need

a dam to be saved.

51. The third sentence of paragraph 1 implies that _____.

[A] people would be happy if they shut their eyes to reality

[B] the blind could be happier than the sighted

[C] over-excited people tend to neglect vital things.

[D] fascination makes people lose their eyesight

[答案] C

[解题思路]

第一段第三句话是“But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind”，意思就是“但使人

着迷的同时也就造成了人们的盲目”。A 选项显然不符合原文的意思，可是首先排除。B 选

项误把原文中的blind 理解为“瞎的”，但这个词语在这里的意思是“盲目的”，因此可以

排除B 和D 选项。C 是正确选项，因为人们在fascinated 的时候都会over-excited，因此选

项的表述符合原文的意思。

[题目译文]

第一段第三句暗示了。

[A] 如果人们对现实视而不见，他们会感到幸福

[B] 盲人可能比有视力的人觉得更加幸福

[C] 过于激动的人们往往忽略了最重要的东西

[D] 对一些事物的着迷使得人们丧失了视力

**1998**年**Passage 4**

400

Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing more and more regional

competition, as population growth in the Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill.

This development - and its strong implications for US politics and economy in years ahead - has

enthroned the South as America’s most densely populated region for the first time in the history of

the nation’s head counting.

Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million people - numerically the third

largest growth ever recorded in a single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4 percent,

lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.

Americans have been migrating south and west in larger number since World War II, and the

pattern still prevails.

Three sun belt states - Florida, Texas and California - together had nearly 10 million more

people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th and

San Antonio from 15th to 10th - with Cleveland and Washington.DC, dropping out of the top 10.

Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow belt, census officials say,

Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too - and so did bigger crops of babies as yesterday’s

“baby boom” generation reached its child bearing years.

Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a related but

newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for places with

more jobs but with fewer people, too. Some instances-

● Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid growth rate - 37.1

percent since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population.

●Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1 percent

respectively. Except fro Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is composed of Western

states with 7.5 million people - about 9 per square mile.

The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow belt to more bearable

climates.

Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious living than

in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, more than any

other state.

In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, mostly to other parts of

the West. Often they chose - and still are choosing - somewhat colder climates such as Oregon,

Idaho and Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization in the Golden

State.

As a result, California’s growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 18.5 percent - little more than

two thirds the 1960s’ growth figure and considerably below that of other Western states.

401

65. We can see from the available statistics that _____ .

[A] California was once the most thinly populated area in the whole US

[B] the top 10 states in growth rate of population were all located in the West

[C] cities with better climates benefited unanimously from migration

[D] Arizona ranked second of all states in its growth rate of population

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本文多次提到加利福尼亚州，但是并没有说其是全美人口最少的州，因此可以首先排除A

选项。文章倒数第五段中谈到“Except for Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is

composed of Western states with 7.5 million people - about 9 per square mile”（除了佛罗里达州

和得克萨斯州外，处于人口增长率前10 位的都是西部各州，共有750 万人——每平方英里

约9 个人），可见B 选项错误。C 选项的表述则过于绝对，在文章中并没有对应的信息。

而文章倒数第五段也谈到“Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1

percent respectively”（内华达和亚利桑那是增长率最高的两个州：其增长率分别为63.5％

和53.1％），D 选项正好符合这句话的细节。

[题目译文]

我们可以从已得到的数据中判断。

[A] 加利福尼亚以前曾经是全美国人口最少的地区

[B] 人口增长排前10 名的州都在西部

[C] 气候条件更好的州都从接纳移民中获益

[D] 亚利桑那州的人口增长率在所有的州中排名第二

**1999**年**Passage 2**

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to tap the

consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies have

started to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such business-to-business sales

make sense because businesspeople typically know what product they’re looking for.

Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its

reliability. "Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them and the supplier,"

says senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are limiting the risk by

402

conducting online transactions only with established business partners who are given access to the

company’ s private internet .

Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available for

marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to "pull"

customers into sites. In the past year, however, software companies have developed tools that

allow companies to "push" information directly out to consumers, transmitting marketing

messages directly to targeted customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen saver

to deliver a continually updated stream of news and advertisements to subscribers’ computer

monitors. Subscribers can customize the information they want to receive and proceed directly to

a company’s Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are already starting to use similar

technologies to push messages to customers about special sales, product offerings, or other events.

But push technology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online culture thinks highly of

the notion that the information flowing onto the screen comes there by specific request. Once

commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction between the Web and

television fades. That’s a prospect that horrifies Net purists.

But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies to

make money. The examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show that a

Web site selling the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, hospitality, and

security will attract online customers. And the cost of computing power continues to free fall,

which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon. People looking back 5 or 10

years from now may well wonder why so few companies took the online plunge.

55. We learn from the beginning of the passage that Web business__

[A] has been striving to expand its market

[B] intended to follow a fanciful fashion

[C] tried but in vain to control the market

[D] has been booming for one year or so

[答案] A

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息为文章第一段，实际上其对应信息正是开篇第一句话“In the first year or so of

Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to tap the consumer market”（在网

上交易刚开始的一两年中，大部分业务活动都是围绕着努力开发消费者市场来进行的），可

见只有A 选项符合答案。B 选项的错误在于第二句也提到网络是“more than a fashion”（不

403

仅仅是一种时尚），因此B 选项并不符合原文。C 选项表述过于悲观和绝对，在原文中也

没有对应信息。D 选项与第一句话的意思相左，原文并没有提到web business 已经进入繁荣

期，相反它还处于初始阶段。

[题目译文]

我们从文中了解到，网上业务。

[A] 一直在努力开拓市场

[B] 打算追赶花哨的时尚

[C] 试图控制市场却遭到了失败

[D] 已经繁荣发展了差不多一年时间

56. Speaking of the online technology available for marketing, the author implies that__

[A] the technology is popular with many Web users

[B] businesses have faith in the reliability of online transactions

[C] there is a radical change in strategy

[D] it is accessible limitedly to established partners

[答案] C

[解题思路]

文章中首先提到“the online technology available for marketing”的地方是第三段的第一句话

“Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available for

marketing”（网络商业模式的另一个重大变化体现在营销策略上）。该句提到的“shift”就

是进一步描述从pull 到push 的变化。因此C 选项符合原文，其中change 对应于shift。

[题目译文]

谈到现在已可以用于营销的网上技术，作者暗示。

[A] 该技术已经在网上用户中广泛使用

[B] 业界对于网上交易可靠性的信心增强

[C] 战略中发生了很大的改变

[D] 该技术只对数量有限的已经建立关系的商业伙伴使用

404

58. We learn from the last paragraph that __

[A] pushing information on the Web is essential to Internet commerce

[B] interactivity , hospitality and security are important to online customers

[C] leading companies began to take the online plunge decades ago

[D] setting up shops in silicon is independent of the cost of computing power

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可将选项与原文一一比较。首先，最后一段的第一句指出“But it is hardly inevitable that

companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies to make money”（然而，网上公司

并不是非得依靠“推销”策略才能挣钱），这说明pushing information 不是最好的策略，因

此A 选项错误。C 选项的表述显然错误，因为网上交易是近几年才兴起的事情。D 选项对

应于该段第三句话“And the cost of computing power continues to free fall, which is a good sign

for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon”（随着计算能力的成本持续大幅度下降，这对任

何建立了网上销售的企业来说都是个好的征兆），显然D 选项与原文意思相反，因为cost of

computing 与setting up a shop in silicon 是有因果关系的。而C 选项对应于该段第二句“The

examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show that a Web site selling the

right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, hospitality, and security will attract

online customers”（像“虚拟葡萄园”和亚马逊网站及其他开拓者的例子都表明：只要网站

销售的产品对路，同时又能将交互性、热情服务、安全可靠性等几个方面合理结合，就一定

会吸引网上的客户），因此是正确选项。

[题目译文]

我们可以从最后一段了解到。

[A] 把信息推倒网上对于互联网商业来说是必不可少的

[B] 相互影响、热情和安全性对于网上用户来说是非常重要的

[C] 有影响力的公司在几十年前就应该当机立断地开始往上业务

[D] 建立网上商店与计算机产品的成本无关

**1999**年**Passage 3**

An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the classroom on the behalf of

students’ career prospects and those arguing for computers in the classroom for broader reasons of

radical educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have explored this distinction-indeed,

405

contradiction--which goes to the heart of what is wrong with the campaign to put computers in the

classroom.

An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of job is a technical education,

justified for reasons radically different from why education is universally required by law. It is not

simply to raise everyone’s job prospects that all children are legally required to attend school into

their teens. Rather, we have a certain conception of the American citizen, a character who is

incomplete if he cannot competently assess how his livelihood and happiness are affected by

things outside of himself. But this was not always the case; before it was legally required for all

children to attend school until a certain age, it was widely accepted that some were just not

equipped by nature to pursue this kind of education. With optimism characteristic of all

industrialized countries, we came to accept that everyone is fit to be educated. Computereducation

advocates forsake this optimistic notion for a pessimism that betrays their otherwise

cheery outlook. Banking on the confusion between educational and vocational reasons for

bringing computers into schools, computer-ed advocates often emphasize the job prospects of

graduates over their educational achievement.

There are some good arguments for a technical education given the right kind of student. Many

European schools introduce the concept of professional training early on in order to make sure

children are properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It is, however, presumptuous

to insist that there will only be so many jobs for so many scientists, so many businessmen, so

many accountants. Besides, this is unlikely to produce the needed number of every kind of

professional in a country as large as ours and where the economy is spread over so many states

and involves so many international corporations.

But, for a small group of students, professional training might be the way to go since welldeveloped

skills, all other factors being equal , can be the difference between having a job and not.

Of course, the basics of using any computer these days are very simple. It does not take a lifelong

acquaintance to pick up various software programs. If one wanted to become a computer engineer,

that is, of course, an entirely different story. Basic computer skills take--at the very longest-a

couple of months to learn. In any case, basic computer skills are only complementary to the host

of real skills that are necessary to becoming any kind of professional. It should be observed, of

course, that no school, vocational or not, is helped by a confusion over its purpose.

61. It could be inferred from the passage that in the author’ s country the European model of

professional training is__

[A] dependent upon the starting age of candidates

[B] worth trying in various social sections

406

[C] of little practical value

[D] attractive to every kind of professional

[答案] C

**1999**年**Passage 4**

When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months ago that it had cloned

an adult sheep, President Clinton moved swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this

unusual animal husbandry technique to clone humans, he ordered that federal funds not be used

for such an experiment-although no one had proposed to do so--and asked an independent panel of

experts chaired by Princeton President Harold Shapiro to report back to the White House in 90

days with recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. That group--the National

Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC)-has been working feverishly to put its wisdom on paper,

and at a meeting on 17 May, members agreed on a near-final draft of their recommendations.

NBAC will ask that Clinton’s 90-day ban on federal funds for human cloning be extended

indefinitely and possibly that it be made law. But NBAC members are planning to word the

recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research that involves the cloning of

human DNA or cells-routine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet reached agreement on a

crucial question, however, whether to recommend legislation that would make it a crime for

407

private funding to be used for human cloning.

In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro suggested

that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be "morally unacceptable to attempt to

create a human child by adult nuclear cloning." Shapiro explained during the meeting that the

moral doubt stems mainly from fears about the risk to the health of the child. The panel then

informally accepted several general conclusions, although some details have not been settled.

NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government funding for any attempt to clone

body cell nuclei to create a child. Because current federal law already forbids the use of federal

funds to create embryos ( the earliest stage of human offspring before birth) for research or to

knowingly endanger an embryo’ s life, NBAC will remain silent on embryo research.

NBAC members also indicated that they will appeal to privately funded researchers and clinics

not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were divided on whether to go

further by calling for a federal law that would impose a complete ban on human cloning. Shapiro

and most members favored an appeal for such legislation, but in a phone interview, he said this

issue was still "up in the air."

63. We can learn from the first paragraph that__

[A] federal funds have been used in a project to clone humans

[B] the White House responded strongly to the news of cloning

[C] NBAC was authorized to control the misuse of cloning technique

[D] the White House has got the panel’s recommendations on cloning

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可采用排除法。A 选项对应于文章第二句话“and asked an independent panel of experts

chaired by Princeton President Harold Shapiro to report back to the White House in 90 days with

recommendations for a national policy on human cloning”（ 并责成成立一个由普林斯顿大学

校长哈罗德·夏皮罗为首的独立专家小组，在90 天内拿出就关克隆人的国家政策提出建议，

并向白宫汇报），可见选项与原文意思相反，因而是错误答案。C 选项对应于同一句话，可

见NBAC 的作用不在于选项所说的“control the misuse of cloning technique”，而是“report back

to the White House in 90 days with recommendations for a national policy on human cloning”。D

选项与最后一句有出入，因为NBAC 只是形成了一个near-final draft，还没有正式向白宫提

交。B 选项从第二句话克林顿政府的种种举措就可以看出来政府的强烈反对态度。

408

[题目译文]

我们可以从第一段中了解到。

[A] 联邦基金已经被用到了克隆人项目上

[B] 白宫对于克隆新闻的反应强烈

[C] NBAC 被授权控制克隆技术的滥用

[D] 白宫已经得到了专家小组关于克隆问题的建议

66. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that__

[A] some NBAC members hesitate to ban human cloning completely

[B] a law banning human cloning is to be passed in no time

[C] privately funded researchers will respond positively to NBAC’s appeal

[D] the issue of human cloning will soon be settled

[答案] A

[解题思路]

最后一段第二句指出“But they were divided on whether to go further by calling for a federal law

that would impose a complete ban on human cloning”（但他们在是否进一步要求联邦立法强

令彻底禁止克隆人这一问题上存在分歧），显然A 选项符合其说法。B 和D 选项与文章最

后“up in the air”意思相反，因为这一问题不会很快得到解决，其中B 选项“in no time”是

“很快”的意思。C 选项无中生有，与原文无关。

[题目译文]

可以从最后一段推断出。

[A] 一些NBAC 成员在彻底禁止人类克隆问题上踌躇不决

[B] 禁止人类克隆的法律很快就会通过

[C] 私人资助的研究人员将会对NBAC 的呼吁作出积极的反应

[D] 人类克隆问题很快就会得到解决

**1999**年**Passage 5**

Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it prepares than on the preparedness of

the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton supposedly discovered gravity

through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in many places for centuries and thousands of

409

people had seen them fall. But Newton for years had been curious about the cause of the orbital

motion of the moon and planets. What kept them in place? Why didn’t they fall out of the sky?

The fact that the apple fell down toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the question

he had been asking himself about those lager fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.

How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the tree?

Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind was

ready for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research. If you don’t

have unpredictable things, you don’t have research. Scientists tend to forget this when writing

their cut and dried reports for the technical journals, but history is filled with examples of it.

In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression that

they find the "scientific method" a substitute for imaginative thought. I’ve attended research

conferences where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the advisability of continuing a

certain experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at the graphs, and said "the data are still

inconclusive." "We know that," the men from the budget office have said, "but what do you think?

Is it worthwhile going on? What do you think we might expect?" The scientist has been shocked at

having even been asked to speculate.

What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the victim of his own writings.

He has put forward unquestioned claims so consistently that he not only believes them himself,

but has convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If experiments are

planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the science journals

indicate, then it is perfectly logical for management to expect research to produce results

measurable in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable for auditors to believe that scientists who

know exactly where they are going and how they will get there should not be distracted by the

necessity of keeping one eye on the cash register while the other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if

regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his

papers would appear to reflect , is management to be blamed for discriminating against the "odd

balls among researchers in favor of more conventional thinkers who "work well with the team. "

70. The author implies that the results of scientific research__

[A] may not be as profitable as they are expected

[B] can be measured in dollars and cents

[C] rely on conformity to a standard pattern

[D] are mostly underestimated by management

[答案] A

410

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章最后一段。该段第三句指出“If experiments are planned and carried out

according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the science journals indicate, then it is perfectly

logical for management to expect research to produce results measurable in dollars and cents”（假

如实验完全按照科学杂志登载的科学报告所陈述的那样按事先的计划去规划和实施，那么，

管理层期待研究能够产生可以用金钱衡量的结果是符合逻辑的），但是第二段第五句指出

“Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research”（ 不可预测性是科学研究不可或

缺的一个重要特征），因此试验产生的结果可能没有预期的好，因此A 选项符合文章的意

思。其余三个选项都与原文内容相反，因为最后一段作者是用假设的口气写的，作者看法与

假设结果相反。

[题目译文]

作者暗示科学研究的成果。

[A] 可能不像预期的那样能够获得丰厚的利润

[B] 可以用美元和美分来衡量

[C] 取决于其是否符合一个标准模式

[D] 通常被管理部门低估了

**2000**年**Passage 1**

A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly handled, it

may become a driving force. When the United States entered just such a glowing period after the

end of the Second World War, it had a market eight ties larger than any competitor, giving its

industries unparalleled economies of scale. Its scientists were the world’s best, its workers the

most skilled. America and Americans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the Europeans and

Asians whose economies the war had destroyed.

It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other countries grew richer. Just as

inevitably, the retreat from predominance proved painful. By the mid-1980s Americans had found

themselves at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. Some huge American industries,

such as consumer electronics, had shrunk or vanished in the face of foreign competition. By 1987

there was only one American television maker left, Zenith.(Now there is none: Zenith was bought

by South Korea’s LG Electronics in July.)Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into the

domestic market America’s machine-tool industry was on the ropes. For a while it looked as

though the making of semiconductors, which America had which sat at the heart of the new

411

computer age, was going to be the next casualty.

All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking prosperity for granted. They

began to believe that their way of doing business was failing, and that their incomes would

therefore shortly begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after another into the

causes of America’s industrial decline. Their sometimes sensational findings were filled with

warnings about the growing competition from overseas.

How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on five years of solid

growth while Japan has been struggling. Few Americans attribute this solely to such obvious

causes as a devalued dollar or the turning of the business cycle. Self-doubt has yielded to blind

pride." American industry has changed its structure, has gone on a diet, has learnt to be more

quick-witted," according to Richard Cavanagh, executive dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of

Government," It makes me proud to be an American just to see how our businesses are improving

their productivity, says Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. And

William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School believes that people will look back on this

period as" a golden age of business management in the United States."

53. What can be inferred from the passage?

[A] It is human nature to shift between self-doubt and blind pried.

[B] Intense competition may contribute to economic progress.

[C] The revival of the economy depends on international cooperation.

[D] A long history of success may pave the way for further development.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题需要将各选项与原文进行一一比较。A 选项对应于原文第四段的第四句话“Self-doubt

has yielded to blind pride”（到如今，对自我怀疑已被盲目乐观所取代），但却与选项的表

述风马牛不相及。C 选项的说法看似有道理，却与原文并没有关系。D 选项对应于文章的第

一句话“A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly

handled, it may become a driving force”（长期轻而易举地获得成功的历史可能成为一种可怕

的不利因素，但若处理得当，这种不利因素也有可能转化为一种积极的推动力），这句话提

出两个可能性的结果，但选项表述则过于绝对。B 选项则是正确答案，因为文中指出美国经

济在80 年代经历滑坡，第三段最后一句指出“Their sometimes sensational findings were filled

with warnings about the growing competition from overseas”（在美国人那些有时耸人听闻的

412

发现中，充满了对来自海外的经济竞争的警告之词），而下一段美国在海外竞争的压力下又

迎头赶上，因此B 选项与原文的意思相符。

[题目译文]

我们可以从文中推断中以下哪一项？

[A] 在自我怀疑和自高自大之间变化是人类的天性

[B] 激烈的竞争可能有利于经济的发展

[C] 经济的复苏取决于国际间的合作

[D] 长期的成功可能为将来的发展铺平道路

54. The author seems to believe the revival of the U.S. economy in the 1990s can be attributed to

the____.

[A] turning of the business cycle

[B] restructuring of industry

[C] improved business management

[D] success in education

[答案] A

[解题思路]

文章最后一段的第三句指出“Few Americans attribute this solely to such obvious causes as a

devalued dollar or the turning of the business cycle”（没几个美国人将这一巨变单纯地归因于

美元贬值或商业周期循环这些显而易见的原因），阅读下一句中作者的评论便可以发现作者

的观点与上述说法正好相反，因而A 为正确选项。B 与C 选项都是作者后面举的反面例子

的论据，而D 选项的“教育”问题在文中没有论及。

[题目译文]

作者看起来相信美国经济在20 世纪90 年代的复苏是由于。

[A] 商业周期的变化

[B] 工业重组

[C] 企业管理的改进

[D] 成功的教育

413

**2000**年**Passage 5**

If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition health, distinction, control over one’s

destiny must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition’s behalf. If the tradition of

ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it especially must be highly regarded by

people who are themselves admired, the educated not least among them. In an odd way, However,

it is the educated who have claimed to have give up on have give up on ambition as an ideal. What

is odd is that they have perhaps most benefited from ambition-if not always their own the that of

their parents and grandparents. There is heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn

door after the horses have escaped with the educated themselves riding on them.

Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly.

Summer homes, European travel, BMWs. The locations, place names and name brands may

change, but such items do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago. What

has happened is that people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily and openly as once they

could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and vulgar. Instead, we are treated to fine

hypocritical spectacles, which now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic of American

materialism with a Southampton summer home; the publisher of radical books who takes his

meals in three-star restaurants; the journalist advocating participatory democracy in all phases of

life, whose own children are enrolled in private schools. For such people and many more perhaps

not so exceptional, the proper formulation is," Succeed at all costs but avoid appearing ambitious."

The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; its public defenders are few

and unimpressive, where they are not extremely unattractive. As a result, the support for ambition

as a healthy impulse, a quality to be admired and fixed in the mind of the young, is probably lower

than it has ever been in the United States. This does not mean that ambition is at an end, that

people no longer feel its stirrings and promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is

less openly underground, or made sly. Such, then, is the way things stand: on the left angry critics,

on the right stupid supporters, and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to

get on in life.

68. The last sentence of the first paragraph most probably implies that it is____.

[A] customary of the educated to discard ambition in words

[B] too late to check ambition once it has been let out

[C] dishonest to deny ambition after the fulfillment of the goal

[D] impractical for the educated to enjoy benefits from ambition

[答案] C

414

[解题思路]

第一段的最后一句为“There is heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn door

after the horses have escaped with the educated themselves riding on them”（这其中有着浓厚的

虚伪色彩，恰如马跑后再关上马厩的门那样，而受过良好教育的人自己正骑在那些马背上）。

仔细分析这句话可以发现，文中的horse 代表了文章讨论的ambition，而是否骑在马上还是

关在马厩分别代表了是否拥有雄心壮志。但享受了ambition 带来的好处却说自己没有

ambition 的人是虚伪的即hypocrisy，这也正是选项C 的意思。Dishonest 是对hypocrisy 的解

释。

[题目译文]

第一段的最后一句话最有可能暗示了。

[A] 受过教育的人习惯把他们的抱负放在心里不说出来

[B] 抱负一旦说出来就很难控制

[C] 达到目的后否认自己有抱负是不诚实的表现

[D] 受过教育的人享受抱负带来的好处是不现实的

70. From the last paragraph the conclusion can be drawn that ambition should be maintained____.

[A] secretly and vigorously

[B] openly and enthusiastically

[C] easily and momentarily

[D] verbally and spiritually

[答案] B

[解题思路]

文章最后一段第三句话指出“This does not mean that ambition is at an end, that people no

longer feel its stirrings and promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is less openly

underground, or made sly”（但这并不意味着雄心已经穷途末路，人们不再感觉到受到雄心

的激励了，只是人们不再公开地以它为荣，更不愿公开地坦白了。当然这样就带来了很多不

良后果，其中的一些后果就是雄心被赶入地下，或暗藏于胸），而且作者认为从始至终都批

评了有抱负却不愿公开承认自己有抱负的那些人，这说明作者是主张人们应该去追求自己的

抱负。A 选项中的secretly 显然与原文意思相反，C 和D 选项则与文章无关。而B 选项则正

确地表达了作者的态度，是正确答案。本题需要充分抓住作者的态度和文章的基调。

415

[题目译文]

从最后一段的结论中可以推断，在坚持自己的抱负时应该。

[A] 秘密行事且精力充沛

[B] 公开且充满热情

[C] 轻松且时时想到

[D] 表现在语言上和精神上

**2001**年**Passage 1**

Specialisation can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of

scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units, one man could continue

to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But specialisation was only

one of a series of related developments in science affecting the process of communication.

Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific activity.

No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science:

exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word 'amateur' does carry a connotation that

the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific community and, in particular, may

not fully share its values. The growth of specialisation in the nineteenth century, with its

consequent requirement of a longer, more complex training, implied greater problems for amateur

participation in science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based

especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the

development of geology in the United Kingdom.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not

simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what

constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local geological studies

represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth century, local studies

have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the

wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have continued to pursue local studies in

the old way. The overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals

harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing,

first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological journals in

the twentieth century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals have now

appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur readership. A rather similar process

of differentiation has led to professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two

416

specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in local societies or to come

together nationally in a different way.

Although the process of professionalisation and specialisation was already well under way in

British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed until the

twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned as the

crucial period for this change in the structure of science.

52. We can infer from the passage that ________.

[A] there is little distinction between specialisation and professionalisation

[B] amateurs can compete with professionals in some areas of science

[C] professionals tend to welcome amateurs into the scientific community

[D] amateurs have national academic societies but no local ones

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题可采用排除法来解决。对于A 选项来说，通过阅读第一、二段可以发现，specialization

主要指的是学科细化，而professionalization 指的是从事科学研究人员的职业化，两个名次

针对的对象是不同的，因而是有区别的，所以A 是错误选项。关于C 选项，文章第三段在

举geology 的例子的时候，在第三句的后半句中指出“but, in the twentieth century, local studies

have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the

wider geological picture”（而到了20 世纪，区域地质学研究越来越倾向于必须体现或思考

更广阔的地质面貌，只有这样它才能够被专业人员接受），因而可见professional 接受amateurs

是有条件的，即后者融入前者的文化价值和规范，但C 选项没有体现这个条件，是错误的。

至于D 选项，第三段一句提到“A rather similar process of differentiation has led to professional

geologists coming together nationally within one or two specific societies, whereas the amateurs

have tended either to remain in local societies or to come together nationally in a different way”

（类似的分化过程也导致专业地质学家聚集在一起，形成一两个全国性的团体，而业余地质

学家则要么留在地方性团体中，要么以不同方式组成全国性的团体），可见业余者也有全国

性组织，因此D 选项与原文不符。因而B 为正确选项，有原文为证，文章第二段第一句话

就表明“No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science:

exceptions can be found to any rule”（在科学领域内，专业与业余之间没有绝对的明确区分），

尽管后面提到了“The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based especially

on a mathematical or laboratory training”（这种趋势特别是在以数学和实验室训练为基础的

417

科学领内自然表现得尤为明显），这仍说明业余者至少在一些科学领域是可以与专业者并驾

齐驱的。

[题目译文]

我们可以从文中推断出。

[A] 专业分工和职业化之间几乎没有区别

[B] 在科学的一些领域，业余人员可以与专业人员竞争

[C] 专业人员往往欢迎业余人员加入科学界

[D] 业余人员有全国性的学术组织，却没有地方性的组织

**2001**年**Passage 4**

The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed. The

process sweeps from hyperactive America to Europe and reaches the emerging countries with

unsurpassed might. Many in these countries are looking at this process and worrying: Won't the

wave of business concentration turn into an uncontrollable anti-competitive force?

There's no question that the big are getting bigger and more powerful. Multinational

corporations accounted for less than 20% of international trade in 1982. Today the figure is more

than 25% and growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing segment of

production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment. In Argentina, for instance,

after the reforms of the early 1990s, multinationals went from 43% to almost 70% of the industrial

production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon has created serious concerns over the role

of smaller economic firms, of national businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world

economy.

I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that

underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower trade and

investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable of meeting

customers' demands. All these are beneficial, not detrimental, to consumers. As productivity

grows, the world's wealth increases.

Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty. Yet it is hard to

imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to competition

that were feared nearly a century ago in the US, when the Standard Oil trust was broken up. The

mergers of telecom companies, such as World Com, hardly seem to bring higher prices for

consumers or a reduction in the pace of technical progress. On the contrary, the price of

communications is coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing—witness Daimler

418

and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan—but it does not appear that consumers are being hurt.

Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few weeks ago, Alan

Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking industry. Who is going to supervise,

regulate and operate as lender of last resort with the gigantic banks that are being created? Won't

multinationals shift production from one place to another when a nation gets too strict about

infringements to fair competition? And should one country take upon itself the role of defending

competition on issues that affect many other nations, as in the US vs. Microsoft case?

65. From paragraph 4 we can infer that ________.

[A] the increasing concentration is certain to hurt consumers

[B] WorldCom serves as a good example of both benefits and costs

[C] the costs of the globalization process are enormous

[D] the Standard Oil trust might have threatened competition

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本文的对应信息为原文第四段，可将选项与原文一一对应来分析。A 选项的说法过于绝对，

而该段第一句指出“Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty”

（目前证明这股合并浪潮是利还是弊的实例并不多），因此是否会损害到消费者的利益尚无

定论。B 选项的错误则在于WorldCom 指是在benefit 方面是一个好的例子，但它并不是作

为costs 方面的例子。C 选项的表述在原文并为提及，因而也不正确。D 选项对应于该段的

第二句话，因而是正确答案。

[题目译文]

从第四段中我们可以推断。

[A] 不断加剧的合并一定会伤害到消费者

[B] 世界电讯在成本和收益两个方面上看都是一个好的例子

[C] 全球化进程的成本是巨大的

[D] 标准石油托拉斯可能曾威胁到其竞争者

**2002**年**Text 1**

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify

shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to

419

show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy

with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different.

If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their

secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their

disorganized bosses.

Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ convention, of a story which works well because

the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown

around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so

on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival

is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his

food and stomps over to a table by himself. “Who is that?" the new arrival asked St. Peter. “On,

that’s God," came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks he’s a doctor."

If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the

experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to make

a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties.

With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider

making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if

you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system.

If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural.

Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and

unforced manner. Often it’s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and

remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a

light-hearted remark.

Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote “If at first

you don’t succeed, give up" or a play on words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration and

understatements. Look at your talk and pickout a few words or sentences which you can turn

about and inject with humor.

43. It can be inferred from the text that public services.

[A] have benefited many people.

[B] are the focus of public attention.

[C] are an inappropriate subject for humor.

[D] have often been the laughing stock.

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope with

work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has resulted in

robotics—the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And if scientists have

yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.

As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence

we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our factories

hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that

thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by

tireless robo-drivers. And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micromechanics,

there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery

with submillimeter accuracy—far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve

with their hands alone.

But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less

human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves—goals that pose a

real challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific error," says Dave Lavery,

manager of a robotics program at NASA, “we can’t yet give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to

reliably interact with a dynamic world."

421

Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite a spell

of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and

microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers

lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.

What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one

hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented—and human perception far more

complicated—than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error of a

machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the human

mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is

irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the

single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer systems on Earth can’t

approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it.

50. The author uses the example of a monkey to argue that robots are .

[A] expected to copy human brain in internal structure.

[B] able to perceive abnormalities immediately.

[C] far less able than human brain in focusing on relevant information.

[D] best used in a controlled environment.

[答案] C

本文对应信息在文章的倒数第二句话“But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing

scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since OPEC agreed to supplycuts

in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last

December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when

prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in

double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom

and doom this time?

The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports.

Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could

push the price higher still in the short term.

Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than in

the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of

petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price, so

even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on pump prices than in the

past.

Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in

the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy,

energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile

telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices)

rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest

Economic Outlook that, it oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in

1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is

less than one-quarter of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing

emerging economies—to which heavy industry has shifted—have become more energy-intensive,

and so could be more seriously squeezed.

One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s,

it has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess

demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic decline. The

423

Economist’s commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year ago. In 1973 commodity

prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.

52. It can be inferred from the text that the retail price of petrol will go up dramatically if

[A] price of crude rises.

[B] commodity prices rise.

[C] consumption rises.

[D] oil taxes rise.

[答案] D

文章中关于retail price 的内容出现在第三段的最后一句“In Europe, taxes account for up to

four-fifths of the retail price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted

effect on pump prices than in the past”（在欧洲，税费在汽油零售价中的比例高达4/5，因此，

即使原油价格发生很大的波动，汽油价格所受的影响也不会像过去那么显著）。可见税费在

汽油零售价格中所占的比重最大，因此只有当油税大幅度提高的时候汽油零售价格才会随之

大幅提高。A 选项的意思与原文相反，而B、C 两个因素与汽油零售价格无关。

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications for

how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.

Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in

effect supported the medical principle of “double effect," a centuries-old moral principle holding

that an action having two effects—a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is

foreseen—is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to

control terminally ill patients’ pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the

patient.

Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield

doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients

sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death."

George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long

as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal

even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. “It’s like surgery," he says. “We don’t call those

deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their

death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their

suicide."

On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate

has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the

425

physical agony of dying.

Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy

of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End

of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced

medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying" as the twin problems

of end-of-life care.

The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospitals, to test knowledge of

aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care,

and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.

Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical initiatives

translate into better care. “Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their

patients are needlessly and predictably suffering," to the extent that it constitutes “systematic

patient abuse." He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear…that painful deaths are

presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should result in license suspension."

56. From the first three paragraphs, we learn that .

[A] doctors used to increase drug dosages to control their patients’ pain.

[B] it is still illegal for doctors to help the dying end their lives.

[C] the Supreme Court strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide.

[D] patients have no constitutional right to commit suicide.

[答案] B

A 选项对应于文章第三段的第一句话“Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify

using high doses of morphine to control terminally ill patients’ pain”（近年来，医生们一直在用

这项原则，为自己替病危患者注射大剂量的吗啡镇痛的做法提供正当的理由），但是显然选

项与原文不符，用大剂量并不表示医生们总是会增加剂量。C 选项对应于文章第二段第一句

话“Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in

effect supported the medical principle of “double effect””（尽管裁决认为，宪法没有赋予医生

帮助病人自杀的权利，然而最高法庭实际上却认可了医疗界的“双重效应”原则），这说明

最高法院的态度至少不是强烈反对。D 选项的对应信息同C 选项，但是原文的意思是“宪

法没有赋予医生帮助病人自杀的权利”，没有提到“宪法没有赋予病人自杀的权力”，因而

也是错误选项。同样，也很容易判断B 是正确选项。

Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster who built the

Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated

with information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the "great game" of

espionage-----spying as a "profession." These days the Net, which has already re-made pastimes

as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan's vocation as well.

The last revolution isn't simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen's e-mail. That

kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the past three or four years, the world

wide web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying. The spooks call it "open

source intelligence," and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly influential. in 1995 the CIA

held a contest to see who could compile the most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large

margin, was a tiny Virginia company called Open-Source Solutions，whose clear advantage was

its mastery of the electronic world.

Among the firms making the biggest splash in the new world is Straitford, Inc., a private

intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the results of

spying(covering nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like energy-services firm

McDermott International. Many of its predictions are available online at www.straitford.com.

Straifford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of mutually

reinforcing tool for both information collection and distribution, a spymaster's dream. Last week

his firm was busy vacuuming up data bits from the far corners of the world and predicting a crisis

in Ukraine." As soon as that report runs, we'll suddenly get 500 new internet sign-ups from

Ukraine," says Friedman, a former political science professor. "And we'll hear back from some of

them." Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since it can be difficult to tell good

information from bad. That’s where Straitford earns its keep.

Friedman relies on a lean staff in Austin. Several of his staff members have militaryintelligence

backgrounds. He sees the firm's outsider status as the key to its success. Straitford's

briefs don't sound like the usual Washington back-and forthing, whereby agencies avoid dramatic

427

declarations on the chance they might be wrong. Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its

independent voice.

44. It can be learned from paragraph 4 that

[A] Straitford's prediction about Ukraine has proved true.

[B] Straitford guarantees the truthfulness of its information.

[C] Straitford's business is characterized by unpredictability.

[D] Straitford is able to provide fairly reliable information.

To paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, “all that is needed for the triumph of a

misguided cause is that good people do nothing.”One such cause now seeks to end biomedical

research because of the theory that animals have rights ruling out their use in research. Scientists

need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public

and thereby threatening advances in health knowledge and care. Leaders of the animal rights

movement target biomedical research because it depends on public funding, and few people

understand the process of health care research. Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in

research settings, many are perplexed that anyone would deliberately harm an animal.

428

For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair

was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that opposed

immunizations, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured that

they do, she replied, “Then I would have to say yes.”Asked what will happen when epidemics

return, she said, “Don’t worry, scientists will find some way of using computers.”Such wellmeaning

people just don't understand.

Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate, understandable,

way-in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the

connection between animal research and a grandmother's hip replacement, a father's bypass

operation a baby's vaccinations, and even a pet's shots. To those who are unaware that animal

research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal

research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.

Much can be done. Scientists could “adopt” middle school classes and present their own

research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, lest animal rights misinformation

go unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research institutions could be

opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. Finally, because the

ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its

cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous

statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive medical treatment. If good

people do nothing there is a real possibility that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the

precious embers of medical progress.

50. From the text we learn that Stephen Cooper is

[A] a well-known humanist.

[B] a medical practitioner.

[C] an enthusiast in animal rights.

[D] a supporter of animal research.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

Stephen Cooper 出现在文章的最后一段，对他的描述是“who has made courageous statements

about the value of animal research”（他对动物实验的价值勇敢地进行了肯定），显然他是支

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems,

causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads

accounted for under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series of

mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the freight moved

by major rail carriers.

Supporters of the new super systems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial cost

reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by

fierce competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities

traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads

therefore have them by the throat.

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only

one rail company. Railroads typically charge such “captive” shippers 20 to 30 percent more than

they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they are being

overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government's Surface Transportation Board for

rate relief, but the process is expensive, time consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.

Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the long

run it reduces everyone's cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue,

shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so,

leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line. It's theory to which many

economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which

companies will flourish and which will fail. “Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who

wins and who loses in the marketplace?” asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who

frequently represents shipper.

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be his with a round of huge rate increases.

430

The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortuning fortunes. still does not earn

enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet

railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street cheering them on.

Consider the .2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail's

net railway operating income in 1996 was just million, less than half of the carrying costs of the

transaction. Who's going to pay for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will,

as Norfolk Southern and CSX increase their grip on the market.

53．It can be inferred from paragraph 3 that

[A] shippers will be charged less without a rival railroad.

[B] there will soon be only one railroad company nationwide.

[C] overcharged shippers are unlikely to appeal for rate relief.

[D] a government board ensures fair play in railway business.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题的对应信息为文章第三段，可以一一与原文对应。首先，A 选项对应于该段第二句话

“The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only one

rail company”（铁路运输业内的大规模联合意味着多数客户只能接受一家公司的服务） ，

选项A 的意思正好与原文相反，因此是错误答案。B 选项也与原文意思相左，因为文章只

谈及铁路公司合并的趋势和可能性，而选项的表述则太过绝对，认为全国只会剩一家铁路公

司，缺乏证据支持。D 选项的表述则与原文无关。再看C 选项，该段最后一句话指出“Shippers

who feel they are being overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government's Surface

Transportation Board for rate relief, but the process is expensive, time consuming, and will work

only in truly extreme cases”（如果客户感到他们被多收费，他们有权上诉到联邦政府的“陆

路运输局”以争取价格下调。但这个过程耗财、耗时，并且只有在极端特殊的情况下才有作

用），因此托运人即使被多收费也不大可能提出申述，因此C 选项是正确答案。

[题目译文]

从第三段中可以推断出

[A] 如果没有竞争对手，对托运人收费将会减少

[B] 全国很快就只剩下一家铁路公司

[C] 那些交了过高费用的托运人不可能上诉要求减少收费

[D] 政府部门保证在铁路竞争中实行公平竞争

It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional.

Small wonder. Americans' life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century. Failing hips

can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minuts surgical

procedure. Such advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was unimaginable when

I entered medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure death-and our

failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.

Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal

conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a

problem to be solved. Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand

everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it's useless. The most obvious example is latestage

cancer care. Physicians-frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of

hope in the patient-too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.

In1950, the U.S. spent .7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be billion. Anyone can

see this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars conclude

that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains

life beyond a certain age-----say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been

quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way”, so that

younger, healthier people can realize their potential.

I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond,

and remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to

be 53.Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is in her 70s, and former Surgeon General

C.Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s.These leaders are living proof that prevention

works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-

year-old, I wish to age as productively as they have.

Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. Ask a physician, I know the

most costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that people in

Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier

lives than we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while

underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people's lives.

56. What is implied in the first sentence?

[A] Americans are better prepared for death than other people.

432

[B] Americans enjoy a higher life quality than ever before.

[C] Americans are over-confident of their medical technology.

[D] Americans take a vain pride in their long life expectancy.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本文第一句话说“It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in

California optional”（据说，在英国死亡是很紧迫的，在加拿大死亡是不可避免的，在加利

福尼亚死亡则是可以选择的）。众所周知，死亡是每一个人都不可避免的，但该句却说美国

人觉得死亡是可以选择的，足以反映出美国人那种自大的情绪和对本国医疗技术发达程度的

过分自信，C 选项正好符合这个意思。选项A 没有在原文中体现出来，选项B 的错误在于

原句是做不同国家间的横向比较，而选项的表述则是时间上的纵向比较，因而不符合题意。

D 选项把重点放在了long life expectancy 上，但是通过阅读第一段的后面几句话可以发现，

文章的重点在medical technology 的发达，因此D 也是干扰项。

[题目译文]

文章第一句话暗示了什么？

[A] 美国人比其他国家的人对死亡所作的准备更加充分。

[B] 美国人现在的生活质量比以前任何时候都要高。

[C] 美国人对于他们的医疗技术过分自信。

[D] 美国人对于他们的预期寿命妄自尊大。

Over the past century， all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned or

made illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet

unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with

a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.

It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over Zodiac

cars when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that

Adam Abbott has in life over Zoeuml; Zysman. English names are fairly evenly spread between

the halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people have surnames beginning

with letters between A and K.

433

Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C

respectively; and 26 of George Bush‘s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first

half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking， six of the seven heads

of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush,

Chirac, Chrétien and Koizumi）. The world’s three top central bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg

and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese

characters. As are the world‘s five richest men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).

Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the

alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot sets in early. At the start of the first year in infant

school， teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their

names. So short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row， and is rarely asked the

improving questions posed by those insensitive teachers. At the time the alphabetically

disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications,

because they get less individual attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.

The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their

awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ. Shortlists

for job interviews, lection ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all tend to be

drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they plough through them.

47. What can we infer from the first three paragraphs?

[A] In both East and West, names are essential to success.

[B] The alphabet is to blame for the failure of Zo Zysman.

[C] Customers often pay a lot of attention to companies’ names.

[D] Some form of discrimination is too subtle to recognize.

[答案] D

在文章的第三段中，其中第二段和第三段都分别作为例子来佐证第一段的观点。A 选型的表

Americans today don‘t place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, entertainers,

and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our children to get a practical

education——not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive antiintellectualism

in our schools aren’t difficult to find.

435

“Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual,”

says education writer Diane Ravitch. “Schools could be a counterbalance.” Razitch‘s latest bock,

_Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms_, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our

schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for

intellectual pursuits.

But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them

vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their ideas

and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing

along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, “We will become a second-rate country. We will have a

less civil society.”

“Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor Richard

Hofstadter in Anti-Intellectualism in American life, a Pulitzer Prize winning book on the roots of

anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of our history, says

Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of

elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence have been considered more noble

qualities than anything you could learn from a book.

Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and rigorous

book learning put unnatural restraints on children: “We are shut up in schools and college

recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know

a thing.” Mark Twain‘s Huckleberry Finn exemplified American anti-intellectualism. Its hero

avoids being civilized——going to school and learning to read——so he can preserve his innate

goodness.

Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we reluctantly

admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to

grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes,

criticizes and imagines.

School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country‘s educational

system is in the grips of people who “joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility to intellect

and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least intellectual promise.”

57. We can learn from the text that Americans have a history of

[A] undervaluing intellect.

[B] favoring intellectualism.

[C] supporting school reform.

[D] suppressing native intelligence.

436

[答案] A

文章第二段第一句明确指出“Schools have always been in a society where practical is more

important than intellectual”（学校总是处于一个社会中，在这个社会里，实用性总是高于知

识性），可见美国人一向不重视知识，与A 选项正好吻合。同时，本文从头至尾都是围绕

着美国人轻视知识这个主题展开的。B 选项的意思正好与原文相反，因此是错误答案。C 选

项也是错误的，文中并没有讲到美国人一向支持学校改革。而D 选项“suppressing”（压制）

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a

colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even

be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human”, with the underlying assumption that

other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by

Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been

published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys, which have all the

necessary ingredients to capture the public imagination. They look cute. They are good-natured,

co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their finicky female

human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services”

than males (although why this is so remains a mystery).

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr Brosnan's and Dr de Waal's study.

The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally,

the monkeys were happy enough to swap pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when

437

two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the

other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.

In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So

when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand

hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her

token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the

chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the

other chamber (in the absence of an actual monkey able to eat it) was enough to induce sullen

behaviour in a female capuchin.

Dr Brosnan and Dr de Waal report that such behaviour is unusual in their trained monkeys.

During two years of bartering prior to these experiments, failure to exchange tokens for food

occurred in fewer than 5% of trials. And what made the behaviour even more extraordinary was

that these monkeys forfeited food that they could see—and which they would have readily

accepted in almost any other set of circumstances.

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In

the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable

only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems,

are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings

abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness

evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor

that the species had 35m years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.

25. What can we infer from the last paragraph?

[A] Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.

[B] Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.

[C] Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.

[D] Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

[答案] B

[解题思路]

在本题的几个选项中，A 和C 选项是显然错误的，因为研究成果中并没有指出猴子可以有

人类社会情感或者像人类那样表达所有情感，因为文章提到的仅仅是猴子面对不公的那种义

Of all the components of a good night's sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In

dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century

ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our

unconscious desires and rears, by the late 1970s. neurologists had switched to thinking of them as

just “mental noise” the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep.

Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind's emotional thermostat, regulating

moods while the brain is “off-line”. And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful

mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us

sleep and feel better, “It's your dream” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago's

Medical Center. “If you don't like it, change it.”

Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye

movement) sleep-when most vivid dreams occur-as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric

Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved, the

limbic system (the “emotional brain”)is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center of

intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy of depressed, and

those feelings can stay with us all day” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr, William Dement.

The link between dreams and emotions show up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most

people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before

awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day.

Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional

significance of the day’s events—until, it appears, we begins to dream.

439

And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise

conscious control over recurring bad dreams As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting

about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead, the next time is occurs, try to

wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it

in their sleep.

At the end of the day, there's probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless

they keep us from sleeping of “we wake u in a panic, ”Cartwright says Terrorism, economic

uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people's anxiety. Those suffering

from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist For the rest of us, the brain has its

ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep-or rather dream-on it and you'll feel better in the

morning.

32. By referring to the limbic system, the author intends to show

[A] its function in our dreams.

[B] the mechanism of REM sleep.

[C] the relation of dreams to emotions.

parts of the brain are equally involved”（并非大脑的各个部分的参与情况都是这样），之后的

recurring bad dreams”（Cartwright 认为，人们可以通过练习有意识地控制反复出现的恶梦），

也就是说，做梦可以被控制、因此并不完全属于潜意识的活动，答案为A 选项。C 选项是

错误的，因为文章认为应该控制梦境，而不是任其发展。B 选项不符合文意的地方在于，不

应该visualize bad dream，而是visualize how you would like it to end，即想象一下这个梦会如

In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for

homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the

casualness and absence of consumption” launched by the 19th--century department stores that

offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a

knowledgeable elite.” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background.

This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports

are other forces for homogenization.

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating

but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports

that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented level nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998

441

immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent .In the 10 years prior to 1990,

3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000.

Now, consider three indices of assimilation –language, home ownership and intermarriage.

The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most

common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The

children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the

original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America

as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign–born immigrants who had arrived before 1970

had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born

Americans.

Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S –born

whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-

Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian–American women are married to non-Asians.

Rodriguez note that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrant living within

the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”

Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to

have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s

social induces suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.

23. The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S.

[A] are resistant to homogenization.

[B] exert a great influence on American culture.

[C] are hardly a threat to the common culture.

[D] constitute the majority of the population.

[答案] C

Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry-William Shakespeare-but there are

two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare

Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial

Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not

to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other

sights.

The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They

frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness.

It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself

an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise - making.

The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus- and often take in

Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side – don’t usually see the plays, and some of them

are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight -

seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the

town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into

the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.

The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy

of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in

town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there,

which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the

Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.

Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy.

(The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were

94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that

costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.

443

It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people

who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They

all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) –lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing

jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the

theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them

when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.

26. From the first two paragraphs , we learn that

[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC ’ s contribution to the town’s revenue

[B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage

[C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms

[D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism

[答案] A

[解题思路]

题目给定了解题的定位范围，即文章的前两段。为了帮助选出正确答案，我们可以将选项一

一对应于文中的信息。A 选型对应的细节是第二段的第一句话，即“The worthy residents of

Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue” （斯特拉特福德的本地乡绅们都

质疑剧院有没有为当地的收入贡献一点力量），也就是说，小镇的居民们否认了RSC 对小

镇收入的贡献，因此A 选型正确。B 选项对应于第二段的最后两句话，但作者仅描述了这

些演员与莎士比亚的共同特征，并没有指出演员在台上台下都可以模仿莎士比亚。C 选项犯

了偷换概念的错误，第一段中提到的两个“branches”是指小镇的居民和RSC，而不是选项中

提到的RSC 两大分支。D 选项显然也是错误的，因为第一段指出镇民们基本上是靠旅游业

取得主要收入的，且第二段第一句描述他们是用了wealthy 这个词，说明镇民们从旅游业中

收入颇丰。

[题目译文]

从开头两段中，我们可以了解到

[A] 居民们否认RSC 对小镇的收入有贡献

[B] RSC 的演员们在台上台下都模仿莎士比亚

[C] RSC 的两大分支之间关系不好

[D] 居民们从旅游业中赚不到很多的钱

444

27. It can be inferred from Para 3 that

[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately

[B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers

[C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers

[D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater

[答案] B

[解题思路]

本题对应的信息在文章第三段。A 选项显然是错误的，因为该段中明确说明观光者们经常去

城堡和宫殿参观，并不把二者分开。关于B 选项，文章认为观光者们通常不会留下来看戏，

因此白天参观之后晚上就可以离开了。相比之下，来看莎剧的人们往往也会做一些旅游观光

活动，而且通常留宿四、五个晚上，给当地的旅馆和酒店带来了大笔收入。因此可以推断看

戏剧的人们比那些观光者们花更多的钱，B 选项正确。C 选项的错误在于该段中没有谈及购

物，因而也无从比较。D 选项的错误在于文章中谈到看莎剧的人们在看戏之外也会去观光旅

游，不只是在剧院里。

[题目译文]

从第三段中可以推断

[A] 观光者不能分别参观城堡和宫殿

[B] 看演出的人比观光者花的钱更多

[C] 观光者比看演出的人更多购物

[D] 看演出的人除了剧院不去小镇的任何地方

30. From the text we can conclude that the author

[A] is supportive of both sides

[B] favors the townsfolk’s view

[C]. takes a detached attitude

[D] is sympathetic to the RSC

[答案] D

[解题思路]

445

本题要求判断作者对于对立的双方——小镇居民和RSC——的态度。文章的二、三、四、

五段在谈及小镇居民时往往用一些否定词，且批驳他们的观点，如实际上观看RSC 演出的

人给小镇带来了更多收入，小镇哭穷但实际上收入不菲等。在谈及剧院时总是表达支持的态

度，如剧院坚持较低的票价、且专门给没有经济实力的年轻人留一部分票额等，这些都说明

作者是支持RSC 而反对居民态度的，因此正确答案为D。C 选项“detached”意为“不偏不倚

的，超然的”，要注意文科方面的文章中作者往往有自己的观点，而理科方面的文章中作者

态度往往是客观的。

[题目译文]

从文中我们可以总结出，作者

[A] 支持双方

[B] 赞同小镇居民们的观点

[C] 持超然的态度

[D] 同情RSC

When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large

animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived, the large, slow-growing animals

were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be

happening in the oceans.

That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years what researchers such as Ransom

Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half

a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods de not attempt to estimate the

actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the

ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in

Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is

reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas,

it has halved again since then.

Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative, one reason for this is that fishing

technology has improved Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which

were not available 50 years ago that means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being

caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded

by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with

fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since to baited hooks would have

446

been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in

the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That

is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise.

Dr. Myers and Dr. worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future

management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among

marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline”. The notion is that people have failed to detect the

massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a

relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum

sustainable yield that can be cropped form a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is

about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to de

business.

31.The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that

[A] large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment

[B] small species survived as large animals disappeared

[C] large sea animals may face the same threat today.

Many things make people think artists are weird and the weirdest may be this: artists only job is

to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited

for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as

insipid, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s

flowers of evil.

448

You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen

such misery. But its not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of

innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the

world today.

After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting

happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass

media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted,

lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy,

the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls

were in peril and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly

need their art to be a bummer too.

Today the messages your average Westerner is bombarded with are not religious but

commercial, and forever happy .Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling,

smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And

since these messages have an agenda--to lure us to open our wallets to make the very idea of

happiness seem unreliable. "Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before

we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

What we forget--what our economy depends on is forgetting--is that happiness is more than

pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss

and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone to tell

us as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that

happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. Its a message even more bitter than a

clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

39. We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes

[A].Happiness more often than not ends in sadness.

[B] The anti-happy art is distasteful by refreshing.

作者在最后一段中关于happiness 的观点是：“happiness is more than pleasure without pain”

（幸福并不只是没有痛苦的快乐），以及“happiness comes not in denying this but in living with

it” （幸福并不等于可以不死，而是要承认会死）因此A 选项明显是错误的，可以排除。C

选项中的should be 与living with 的意思不符，可以排除。D 选项是无中生有，也不正确。

B 选项与最后一句“Its a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath

of fresh air”（这样的信息可能比丁香烟更令人觉得苦涩，然而在某种程度上，它也许是一

股清新的气息）意思基本符合，是正确选项。

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column

called “Ask Marilyn." People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at

a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 -- the highest score ever

recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has

been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit

confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What's

the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It's not

obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to

answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.

Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be

smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from

neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?

The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests

are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-

Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children's

version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists,

although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like

vos Savant's are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population

450

distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age

and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)

and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.

Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in

school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence

Testing?", Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to

measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life

success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations

change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under

low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with

leadership -- that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that

test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.

27. What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?

[A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.

[B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.

[C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.

[D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.

[答案] C

本题题干中已确定信息为第三段。A 选项明显与该段第一句话“The defining term of

intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as

they used to be”（人类有关智力的定义性术语似乎仍然是智商分数，即使人们并不像以前那

样经常进行智商测试）的意思相反，可以首先排除。B 选项具有很强的干扰性，其对应于该

段第三句话“Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by

psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web”（ 智

商测试主要有为两种形式：斯坦福-比奈特智力衡量表和韦氏智力衡量表（两种都包含成人

和儿童两个版本）），但versions（版本）与原文的variations（变体，也就是同一版本有不

同的变体）意思有出入，也是错误选项。D 选项的表述则与第三段无关。C 选项对应于该段

第二句“The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the

Wechsler intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children's version)”（ 尽管这些测试的变

**2007**年**Text 3**

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard

work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been transformed by economic risk and

new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from

solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family

economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications

of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today's

families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost

the parachute they once had in times of financial setback -- a back-up earner (usually Mom) who

could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This "added-worker

effect" could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to

help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made

up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.

During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement

income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions

of families who must worry about interest-rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality

that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush

campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all

of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families,

the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by

families have risen -- and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative

halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk

for families' future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as

the odds of having a weak elderly parent -- and all the attendant need for physical and financial

assistance -- have jumped eightfold in just one generation.

From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an

opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening

acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The

financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.

453

34. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that

[A] financial risks tend to outweigh political risks.

[B] the middle class may face greater political challenges.

[C] financial problems may bring about political problems.

[D] financial responsibility is an indicator of political status.

[答案] C

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章的最后一段最后一句话“The financial fallout has begun, and the political

fallout may not be far behind”（经济副作用已经开始了，政治副作用可能也不远了），这句

话暗含的意思是中产阶级在面临经济危机的同时还很有可能面临政治危机，因此C 选项符

合题意。A、B、D 选项都是对这句话的误读，可以分别排除。

[题目译文]

可以从文章最后一段推测

[A] 财务风险往往比政治风险重要

[B] 中产阶级可能面临更大的政治挑战

[C] 财务问题可能带来政治问题

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst

accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new

problem threatens to earn them -- especially in America -- the sort of nasty headlines that

inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, lowlevel

IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking,

telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss's agenda in businesses of

every variety.

Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year – from organizations as

diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp

and even the University of California, Berkeley -- have left managers hurriedly peering into their

intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.

454

"Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset," says Haim

Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. "The ability to guard customer data is the

key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders". Indeed, just as

there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for

GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’s Columbia

Business School. "Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a

management issue, not a technical one," he says.

The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to

the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and

hugely expensive to restore -- and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company

letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.

The current state of affairs may have been encouraged -- though not justified -- by the lack of

legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law,

American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may

change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America,

disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’s

Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if

firms fail to provide adequate data security.

40. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that

[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe.

[B] FTC’s decision is essential to data security.

[C] California takes the lead in security legislation.

[D] legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题对应于文章的最后一段。首先，原文中并没有比较美国和欧洲在数据泄漏问题上的严重

性，因此A 选项显然是错误的。C 选项对应于该段第一、二句话“The current state of affairs may

have been encouraged -- though not justified -- by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not

Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to

tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray”（ 目前的情况可能与缺乏有关数据泄露的

法律处罚（在美国，不是在欧洲）有关，尽管还没有的到证实。在加利福尼亚最近通过了一

项法律之前，美国公司不必告知任何人关于数据的泄露情况，甚至包括受害人），第一句话

的括号内容显示欧洲早已有这方面的立法，因此加州在这方面不是领头羊。B 和D 都对应

于该段最后一句话“Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card

accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day

earlier by America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that

While still catching-up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way

ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing

depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda,

chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.

Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affects the

stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do

males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their

ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those

of the males.

Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities”

for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much

more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater

than men’s,” she observes, “It’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they

become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”

456

Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that

women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are

exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds

of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by,

unfortunately, parents or other family numbers, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wearand-

tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”

Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but wad determined to finish college.

“I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my

escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later her marriage ended and she became a

single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the

car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”

Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most

women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain.

Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it

threatens your health and your ability to function.

22. Dr. Yehuda’s research suggests that women

[A] Need extra doses of chemicals to handle stress.

[B] Have limited capacity for tolerating stress.

[C] Are more capable of avoiding stress.

[D] Are exposed to more stress.

[答案] D

chemicals, are her increased “opportunities” for stress”（妇女除了能够不断产生更多的化学物

质外，她们受到压力的“机会”也更多），该段后面继续指出女性实际上或许更善于容忍压

力，是因为面对的压力比男性要多得多，所以才容易在压力面前表现出焦虑，因此正确答案

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory

would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the

authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review.

Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or

decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of

the results would have to subscribe to the journal.

No longer. The Internet–and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why

commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting

access to it- is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic

Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching

consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and

Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made

handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now,

been a key element of scientific endeavor.

The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in

part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core

scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The

International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are

more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than

1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.

This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals

are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main institutional

subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing

agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his

employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where

organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional

repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access,

where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making

it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form

of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.

458

28. According to the text, online publication is significant in that

[A] it provides an easier access to scientific results.

[B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers.

[C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge.

[D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research.

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National

Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however,

he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed

dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team

uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.

The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have

generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago,

today’s people- especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many

459

generations- apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get

any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty

much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright

State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from

the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.

Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients –

notably, protein – to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition

and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and

adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years,

a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention, average height- 5′9 〞for men, 5′4 〞for women- hasn’t really

changed since 1960.

Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During

childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even

though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle

with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs.

“There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual

organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.

Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon,

senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent

of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for

basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to

predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by

and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”

34. We learn from the last paragraph that in the near future

[A] the garment industry will reconsider the uniform size.

[B] the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged.

[C] genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen.

[D] the existing data of human height will still be applicable.

In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington,

52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw- having

extracted them from the months of his slaves.

That’s far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember

from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles

slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by

DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had

fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have

scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral

compromises made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s

infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was

wrong and yet most did little to fight it.

More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of

their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also

understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped

to create.

For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was “like

having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George

461

Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have

signed the Constitution without protections for the “peculiar institution,” including a clause

that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.

And the statesmen’s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed

Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the

southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the

Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave

states.

Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children- though not Hemings herself or his

approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were

created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War,

overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will.

Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.

37. We may infer from the second paragraph that

[A] DNA technology has been widely applied to history research.

[B] in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate situations.

[C] historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson’s life.

[D] political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. history.

[答案] D

[解题思路]

本题可以采取排除法。关于A 选项，文章第二段谈到了DNA 技术，但是只提到了一个例子，

至于该技术是否已经在历史研究中广泛利用则不得而知，因此可以首先排除A 选项。B 选

项对应于该段倒数第二句的“the fragile nature of the country’s infancy”（最不稳固的建国

初期），delicate situation 与原文的意思有所出入。C 选项则完全错误，不符合原文。而最后

the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s infancy. More significantly,

they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong and yet most did little

to fight it”（一些历史学家的著作揭示了美国的早期领导人在最不稳固的建国初期作出的道

德妥协。更加重要的是，他们认为很多开国元勋们知道奴隶制是错误的——但是他们很少用

slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the

country they helped to create”（当华盛顿和杰弗逊在私底下表达他们对于奴隶制不满时，

他们也知道奴隶制是他们创建的这个国家的政治经济基础的一部分），第五段进一步指出了

正式由于奴隶制才使得他能够入主白宫。因此，虽然Jefferson 知道奴隶制是错误的，但是

他又作出了compromise(妥协)，他对待奴隶制的态度是非常复杂的“complex”，所以

正确答案为C。

account,””（一方面，南方的各个州无法承担废除奴隶制带来的损失。拥有奴隶“就像拥有

一张数额巨大的银行存折”），原文只是将拥有奴隶比作拥有很多银行存款，并不是奴隶主

Passage 1

Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life

can be starved and damaged? Judging from the drastic experiment of Frederick Ⅱ in the

thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he

heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.

All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language

here. What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life

464

especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.

Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children

are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive

to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If these

sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never

be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right time, but the

process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.

Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence and at a constant age,

but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of

high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months he

can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a

vocabulary of three to fifty words. At three he knows about l,000 words which he can put into

sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than

grammar.

Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special

about man’s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a

child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern "toy-bear". And

even more incredible is the young brain’s ability to pick out an order in language from the

mixture of sound around him, to analyse, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in

new ways.

But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the

child , where the mother recognizes the signals in the child’ s babbling (咿呀学语) , grasping

and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the

interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals.

Sensitivity to the child’s non-verbal signals is essential to the growth and development of

language.

31. The purpose of Frederick II’s experiment was__

[A] to prove that children are born with the ability to speak

[B] to discover what language a child would speak without hearing any human speech

[C] to find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching a child to speak

[D] to prove that a child could be damaged without learning a language

32. The reason some children are backward in speaking is most probably that__

[A] they are incapable of learning language rapidly

465

[B] they are exposed to too much language at once

[C] their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak

[D] their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them

33. What is exceptionally remarkable about a child is that

[A]. he is born with the capacity to speak

[B] he has a brain more complex than an animal’s

[C] he can produce his own sentences

[D] he owes his speech ability to good nursing

34. Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage?

[A] The faculty of speech is inborn in man.

[B] Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in language learning.

[C] The child’s brain is highly selective.

[D] Most children learn their language in definite stages.

35. If a child starts to speak later than others, he will

[A] have a high IQ

[B] be less intelligent

[C] be insensitive to verbal signals

[D] not necessarily be backward

Passage 2

In general, our society is becoming one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic (官

僚主义的) management in which man becomes a small , well-oiled cog in the machinery.

The oiling is done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped music, and by

psychologists and "human-relations" experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man

has become powerless, that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and that he is

bored with it. In fact, the blue-and the white-collar workers have become economic puppets

who dance to the tune of automated machines and bureaucratic management.

The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might find themselves out of

a job; they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest

in life. They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental realities of human

existence as emotionally and intellectually independent and productive human beings.

Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their lives are no less empty than

those of their subordinates. They are even more insecure in some respects. They are in a

highly competitive race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary but even

more a matter of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are tested for

intelligence as well as for the tight mixture of submissiveness and independence. From that

moment on they are tested again and again-by the psychologists, for whom testing is a big

business, and by their superiors, who judge their behavior, sociability, capacity to get along,

etc. This constant need to prove that one is as good as or better than one’ s fellow-competitor

creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes of unhappiness and illness.

nineteenth-century "free enterprise" capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never solved by

returning to a stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming our social system

from a bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and

consumption are ends in themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full

development of his potentialities-those of love and of reason-are the aims of all social

arrangements. Production and consumption should serve only as means to this end, and

should be prevented from ruling man.

[A] a necessary part of the society though each individual’s function is negligible

[B] working in complete harmony with the rest of the society

[C] an unimportant part in comparison with the rest of the society, though functioning

smoothly

[D] a humble component of the society, especially when working smoothly

37. The real cause of the anxiety of the workers and employees is that

[A] they are likely to lose their jobs

[B] they have no genuine satisfaction or interest in life

[C] they are faced with the fundamental realities of human existence

[D] they are deprtved of their individuality and independence

[A] who are at the bottom of the society

[B] who are higher up in their social status

[C] who prove better than their fellow-competitors

[D] who could keep far away from this competitive world

39. To solve the present social problems the author suggests that we should

[A] resort to the production mode of our ancestors

[B] offer higher wages to the workers and employees

[C] enable man to fully develop his potentialities

[D] take the fundamental realities for granted

40. The author’s attitude towards industrialism might best be summarized as one of __

[A] approval

Passage 3

When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him:

he can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.

A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by

which the inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his

invention to the public after that period terminates. Only in the most exceptional

circumstances is the lifespan of a patent extended to alter this normal process of events.

The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV

and again-by the psychologists, for whom

testing is a big business, and by their

superiors, who judge their behavior,

sociability, capacity to get along, etc. This

constant need to prove that one is as good as

or better than one’ s fellow-competitor creates

constant anxiety and stress, the very causes of

unhappiness and illness.

the preindustrial mode of production or to

capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never

solved by returning to a stage which one has

already outgrown. I suggest transforming our

production and consumption are ends in

473

receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent’ s normal life there

was no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention.

Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the

library attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that are free

for anyone to use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent

experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a search through

live patents that the one sure way of avoiding violation of any other inventor’ s right is to

plagiarize a dead patent. Likewise, because publication of an idea in any other form

permanently invalidates further patents on that idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from

other areas of print. Much modern technological advance is based on these presumptions of

legal security.

Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most "new" ideas are, in

fact, as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or

dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. The

basic patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original

ideas behind television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the

Volkswagen rear engine car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the

rear.

41. The passage is mainly about

[A] an approach to patents

[B] the application for patents

[C] the use of patents

[D] the access to patents

42. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

[A] When a patent becomes out of effect, it can be re-patented or extended if necessary.

[B] It is necessary for an inventor to apply for a patent before he makes his invention public.

[C] A patent holder must publicize the details of his invention when its legal period is over.

[D] One can get all the details of a patented invention from a library attached to the patent

[B] give reward to

[C] make public

[D] take and change

Passage I

The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, marketoriented

economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending

their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private

businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with

other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely

determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic

system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to

478

maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together

determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it.

An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer

demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this

mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response

to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in

short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be

eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in

reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in

turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the

regulating mechanism in the American economic system.

The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own

productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over

natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American

economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive

resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to

make a free contract with another private individual.

[A] Americans are never satisfied with their incomes

[B] Americans tend to overstate their incomes

[C] Americans want to have their incomes increased

[D] Americans want to increase the purchasing power of their incomes

**[**全文译文**]**

The American economic system is

organized around a basically privateenterprise,

market-oriented economy in which

consumers largely determine what shall be

produced by spending their money in the

marketplace for those goods and services that

they want most. Private businessmen, striving

to make profits, produce these goods and

services in competition with other

businessmen; and the profit motive, operating

under competitive pressures, largely

determines how these goods and services are

produced. Thus, in the American economic

system it is the demand of individual

consumers, coupled with the desire of

businessmen to maximize profits and the

desire of individuals to maximize their

incomes, that together determine what shall

be produced and how resources are used to

produce it.

An important factor in a market-oriented

economy is the mechanism by which

consumer demands can be expressed and

responded to by producers. In the American

economy, this mechanism is provided by a

price system, a process in which prices rise

and fall in response to relative demands of

consumers and supplies offered by sellerproducers.

If the product is in short supply

relative to the demand, the price will be bid

up and some consumers will be eliminated

从根本上说，美国经济体制是围绕私

有企业、在以市场为导向的经济基础上建

立起来的。在这种体制下需要生产什么在

很大程度上是消费者通过到市场花钱购买

他们最需要的商品和服务来决定的。为了

获取利润，私有企业主在与他人竞争中生

产产品，提供服务。在竞争的压力下追求

利润的动机以及如何运作在很大程度上决

定生产商品和提供服务的方式。因此，在

美国经济体制中，消费者个人的需求，加

上商人获取最大利润的追求及消费者想最

大限度提高购买力的愿望三者共同决定应

该生产什么和如何利用资源来生产这些产

品。

市场型经济中的一个重要因素是反映

消费者需求以及生产者对消费者需求作出

反应的机制。在美国经济中，这一机制是

由价格体制体现的，价格随消费者的相对

需求与生产者的供应情况而上下浮动。如

果供不应求，价格就上升，有些消费者就

会被排挤出市场。另一方面，某种产品大

量生产导致成本下降，生产者提供的产品

就会增加，这就会使价格下跌，那么，更

多的消费者就会购买该产品。因此，价格

是美国经济体制中的调节机制。

Passage 2

One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card.

They give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the

country, and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and

more of these credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or

deposit money in scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many

of us the "cashless society" is not on the horizon—it’s already here.

While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for

sellers too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can

keep a wide range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information

allows businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold

and how fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be

from the market. If, on the other hand,

producing more of a commodity results in

reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the

supply offered by seller-producers, which in

turn will lower the price and permit more

consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is

the regulating mechanism in the American

economic system.

Passage 3

Exceptional children are different in some significant way from others of the same age. For

these children to develop to their full adult potential, their education must be adapted to those

differences.

Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find ourselves describing their

environment as well. While the leading actor on the stage captures our attention, we are aware

much more than simply ring up sales. They

can keep a wide range of records, including

who sold what, when, and to whom. This

and the society in which exceptional children live are often the key to their growth and

understanding—the knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the next generation.

Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that minor we can see the strengths,

the weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and the central values of the culture itself. The

great interest in exceptional children shown in public education over the past three decades

indicates the strong feeling in our society that all citizens, whatever their special conditions,

deserve the opportunity to fully develop their capabilities.

"All men are created equal.” We’ve heard it many times, but it still has important meaning

for education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used by this country’s

founders to denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to mean equality of

opportunity. That concept implies educational opportunity for all children-the right of each

child to receive help in learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that capacity be

small or great. Recent court decisions have confirmed the right of all children-disabled or notto

an appropriate education, and have ordered that public schools take the necessary steps to

provide that education. In response, schools are modifying their programs, adapting

instruction to children who are exceptional, to those who cannot profit substantially from

regular programs.

59. In Paragraph 2, the author cites the example of the leading actor on the stage to show that

[A] the growth of exceptional children has much to do with their family and the society

[B] exceptional children are more influenced by their families than normal children are

[C] exceptional children are the key interest of the family and society

[D] the needs of the society weigh much heavier than the needs of the exceptional children

60. The reason that the exceptional children receive so much concern in education is that__.

[A] they are expected to be leaders of the society

[B] they might become a burden of the society

[C] they should fully develop their potentials

[D] disabled children deserve special consideration

61. This passage mainly deals with__.

[A] the differences of children in their learning capabilities

[B] the definition of exceptional children in modern society

486

[C] the special educational programs for exceptional children

[D] the necessity of adapting education to exceptional children

62. From this passage we learn that the educational concern for exceptional children ___.

Passage 4

“I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we’ll know in vast detail how cancer

cells arise,” says microbiologist Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. “But,” he cautions,

“some people have the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure will rapidly follow.

Consider Pasteur. He discovered the causes of many kinds of infections, but it was fifty or

sixty years before cures were available.”

This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from cancer will survive at least

five years. In the year 2000, the National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 75

percent. For some skin cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90 percent. But other

survival statistics are still discouraging-----13 percent for lung cancer, and 2 percent for

cancer of the pancreas (胰腺).

With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how cancer works is not easy. The

researchers made great progress in the early 1970s, when they discovered that oncogenes,

which are cancer-causing genes (基因), are inactive in normal cells. Anything from cosmic

rays to radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains unknown. If

several oncogenes are driven into action, the cell, unable to turn them off, becomes cancerous.

The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the likelihood that many cancers

are initiated at the level of genes suggests that we will never prevent all cancers. "Changes are

a normal part of the evolutionary process," says oncologist William Haywar. Environmental

educational opportunity for all children-the

right of each child to receive help in learning

factors can never be totally eliminated; as Hayward points out, "We can’t prepare a medicine

The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter. "First, we need to understand how

the normal cell controls itself. Second, we have to determine whether there are a limited

number of genes in cells which are always responsible for at least part of the trouble. If we

can understand how cancer works, we can counteract its action. "

63. The example of Pasteur in the passage is used to__.

[A] predict that the secret of cancer will be disclosed in a decade

[B] indicate that the prospects for curing cancer are bright

[C] prove that cancer will be cured in fifty to sixty years

[D] warn that there is still a long way to go before cancer can be conquered

[A] there will be a drastic rise in the five-year survival rate of skin-cancer patients

[B] 90 percent of the skin-cancer patients today will still be living

[C] that can be driven out of normal cells

Passage 5

Discoveries in science and technology are thought by "untaught minds" to come in blinding

flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would

have it, look at the mold (霉) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and

discovering how cancer works is not easy.

The researchers made great progress in the

early 1970s, when they discovered that

The prospects for cure, though still distant,

how the normal cell controls itself. Second,

we have to determine whether there are a

limited number of genes in cells which are

then. He experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his

discovery. Inventions and innovations almost always come out of laborious trial and error.

Innovation is like soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked

much more frequently than they score.

The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the

goal—and so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between

innovation and others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work

consciously on theirs, and they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise.

What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid

possibilities.

“Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there’s no particular virtue in

doing things the way they have always been done,” wrote Rudolph Flexh, a language

authority, this accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage

bags and suitcases on wheels that make life more convenient : "How come nobody thought of

that before?” The creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as it appears.

Innovators will not accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from

A to B, the average person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently

simplest route. The innovator will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the

long run and are bound to be more interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends.

Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.

67. What does the author probably mean by “untaught mind” in the first paragraph?

[A] A person ignorant of the hard work involved in experimentation.

[B] A citizen of a society that restricts personal creativity.

[C] A person who has had no education.

[A] The variety of ideas they have.

[B] The intelligence they possess.

[C] The way they deal with problems.

innovations almost always come out of

laborious trial and error. Innovation is like

soccer; even the best players miss the goal

and have their shots blocked much more

The point is that the players who score

most are the ones who take most shots at the

between innovation and others is one of

innovators work consciously on theirs, and

they follow them through until they prove

people see as fanciful abstractions,

professional innovators see as solid

possibilities.

“Creative thinking may mean simply the

realization that there’s no particular virtue in

doing things the way they have always been

seemingly simple innovations like plastic

Passage l

Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to

assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable price, thereby establishing a firm home

market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing

attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase

demand it ensures an increased need for labour, and is therefore an effective way to fight

unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily

newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to

be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more.

And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in

the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven acts of Parliament

govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live

up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through

misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good

sense not to buy the inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently

advertised, it is the surest proof I know that the article does what is claimed for it , and that it

represents good value.

Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can

think of.

There is one more point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television

personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs.

He was drawing excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to persuade.

If its message were confined merely to information-and that in itself would be difficult if

not impossible to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly

persuasive----advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But

perhaps that is what the well-known television personality wants.

the best-known and apparently simplest route.

The innovator will search for alternate

courses, which may prove easier in the long

run and are bound to be more interesting and

challenging even if they lead to dead ends.

Highly creative individuals really do march

to a different drummer.

51. By the first sentence of the passage the author means that__.

[A] he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising

[B] everybody knows well that advertising is money consuming

[C] advertising costs money like everything else

[D] it is worthwhile to spend money on advertising

52. In the passage, which of the following is NOT included in the advantages of advertising?

[A] Securing greater fame.

[B] Providing more jobs.

[C] Enhancing living standards.

[D] Reducing newspaper cost.

53. The author deems that the well-known TV personality is_.

[A] very precise in passing his judgment on advertising

[B] interested in nothing but the buyers’ attention

[C] correct in telling the difference between persuasion and information

[D] obviously partial in his views on advertising

54. In the author’s opinion,__.

[A] advertising can seldom bring material benefit to man by providing information

[B] advertising informs people of new ideas rather than wins them over

Passage 2

There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People

have generally viewed personal growth as an external result or product that can easily be

identified and measured. The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades

improve, the foreigner who learns a new language-all these are examples of people who have

measurable results to show for their efforts.

By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since by

definition it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The

process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or

courage, as they encounter new experiences and unexpected obstacles. In this process, the

journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to

try, new challenges to accept.

In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to

confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may “fail” at first. How we see

our-selves as we try a new way of being is essential to our ability to grow. Do we perceive

ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open

to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we’re shy and indecisive? Then our sense of timidity

can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step until we know the ground is

safe. Do we think we’re slow to adapt to change or that we’re not smart enough to cope with a

new challenge? Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all.

These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to

change and grow. If we do not confront and overcome these internal fears and doubts, if we

protect ourselves too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped inside a shell of our

own making.

55. A person is generally believed to achieve personal growth then__.

[A] he has given up his smoking habit

[B] he has made great efforts in his work

[C] he is keen on learning anything new

[D] he has tried to determine where he is on his journey

500

56. In the author’s eyes, one who views personal growth as a process would__.

[A] succeed in climbing up the social ladder

[B] judge his ability to glow from his own achievements

[C] face difficulties and take up challenges

[D] aim high and reach his goal each time

57. When the author says "a new way of being" (line2-3, Para. 3) he is referring to__.

[A] a new approach to experiencing the world

[B] a new way of taking risks

[C] a new method of perceiving ourselves

[D] a new system of adaptation to change

58. For personal growth, the author advocates all of the following except_.

[A] curiosity about more chances

[B] promptness in self-adaptation

[C] open-mindedness to new experiences

[D] avoidance of internal fears and doubts

Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual

now has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one

piece of information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated , time-consuming

and sometimes even overwhelming .

Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies

which enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more

locations than has ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store

vast amounts of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific

information. Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via

television, radio, and very shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of

messages. Satellites have extended the power of communications to report events at the

instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared world wide through teleconferencing, and

problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to

travel to a distant conference site. Technology has facilitated the sharing of information and

the storage and delivery of information, thus making more information available to more

people.

In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance.

Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day

problems, the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and

succeed. "Knowledge is power" may well be the truest saying and access to information may

be the most critical requirement of all people.

59. The word "it" (line 3, para. 2) most probably refers to__.

[A] the lack of stable communities

[B] the breakdown of informal information channels

[C] the increased mobility of families

(D) the growing number of people moving from place to place

60. The main problem people may encounter today arises form the fact that__.

[A] they have to learn new things consciously

[B] they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy information

[C] they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily

(D) they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended family.

504

61. From the passage we can infer that__.

[A] electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting messages

[B] it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an information era

[C] people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences

(D) events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites

62. We can learn from the last paragraph that __.

Passage 4

Personality is to a large extent inherent--A-type parents usually bring about A-type

offspring. But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if competition is

important to the parents, it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.

One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a

highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the ‘win at all costs’ moral standard

and measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children

Personality is to a large extent inherent--Atype

parents usually bring about A-type

offspring. But the environment must also

have a profound effect, since if competition is

important to the parents, it is likely to become

a major factor in the lives of their children.

One place where children soak up Acharacteristics

is school, which is, by its very

nature, a highly competitive institution. Too

many schools adopt the ‘win at all costs’

moral standard and measure their success by

sporting achievements. The current passion

for making children compete against their

classmates or against the clock produces a

two-layer system, in which competitive Atypes

seem in some way better than their Btype

Passage 5

That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an obvious but

nevertheless remarkable activity called remembering. Learning could not occur without the

function popularly named memory. Constant practice has such as effect on memory as to lead

to skillful performance on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and

understanding these words. So-called intelligent behaviour demands memory, remembering

being a primary requirement for reasoning. The ability to solve any problem or even to

recognize that a problem exists depends on memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street

is based on remembering many earlier experiences.

Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task or for any learned

material. Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and the

adaptive consequences may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting

can seem to be adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be intffpreted to have survived

through a process of natural selection in animals. Indeed, when one’s memory of an

emotionally painful experience lead to serious anxiety, forgetting may produce relief.

Nevertheless, an evolutionary interpretation might make it difficult to understand how the

commonly gradual process of forgetting survived natural selection.

In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its possible aspects, it is

helpful to consider what would happen if memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids

orientation in time, since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing clues

for inferring duration. Without forgetting, adaptive ability would suffer, for example, learned

behaviour that might have been correct a decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of

people who (by ordinary standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were full of

confusion. This forgetting seems to serve that survival of the individual and the species.

Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited capacity that provides

adaptive flexibility specifically through forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are

made between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). Indeed, there is

evidence that the rate at which individuals forget is directly related to how much they have

learned. Such data offers gross support of contemporary models of memory that assume an

input-output balance.

67. From the evolutionary point of view,__.

[A] forgetting for lack of practice tends to be obviously inadaptive .

[B] if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be very adaptive

[C] the gradual process of forgetting is an indication of an individual’ s adaptability

[D] sudden forgetting may bring about adaptive consequences

68. According to the passage, if a person never forgot,__.

[A] he would survive best

[B] he would have a lot of trouble

[C] his ability to learn would be enhanced

[D] the evolution of memory would stop

69. From the last paragraph we know that__.

[A] forgetfulness is a response to learning

[B] the memory storage system is an exactly balanced input-output system

[C] memory is a compensation for forgetting

[D] the capacity of a memory storage system is limited because forgetting occurs

Passage l

Tight-lipped elders used to say, "It’s not what you want in this world, but what you get.”

Psychology teaches that you do get what you want if you know what you want and want the

right things.

You can make a mental blueprint of a desire as you would make a blueprint of a house, and

each of us is continually making these blueprints in the general routine of everyday living. If

we intend to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, decide which

food to cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type of meal to be served.

Likewise, if you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and write a brief account of

yourself. In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself, for when you know exactly

what you have to offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.

This account of yourself is actually a sketch of your working life and should include

education, experience and references. Such an account is valuable. It can be referred to in

filling out standard application blanks and is extremely helpful in personal interviews. While

talking to you, your could-be employer is deciding whether your education, your experience,

and other qualifications will pay him to employ you and your "wares" and abilities must be

displayed in an orderly and reasonably connected manner.

When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have

something tangible to sell. Then you are ready to hunt for a job. Get all the possible

information about your could-be job. Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job and

the firm. Keep your eyes and ears open, and use your own judgment. Spend a certain amount

of time each day seeking the employment you wish for, and keep in mind: Securing a job is

your job now.

51. What do the elders mean when they say, “It’s not what you want in this world, but what

you get.”?

[A] You’ll certainly get what you want.

[B] It’s no use dreaming.

[C] You should be dissatisfied with what you have.

[D] It’s essential to set a goal for yourself.

516

52. A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner is used in this passage as__.

[A] an illustration of how to write an application for a job

[B] an indication of how to secure a good job

[C] a guideline for job description

[D] a principle for job evaluation

53. According to the passage, one must write an account of himself before starting to find a

job

because __.

[A] that is the first step to please the employer

[B] that is the requirement of the employer

[C] it enables him to know when to sell his services

[D] it forces him to become clearly aware of himself

54. When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have

something__.

Passage 2

With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers in Asia and America

can now watch the Corporation’s news coverage, as well as listen to it. And of course in

Britain listeners and viewers can tune in to two BBC television channels, five BBC national

radio services and dozens of local radio station. They are brought sport, comedy, drama,

music, news and current affairs, education, religion, parliamentary coverage, children’s

pragrammes and films for an annual license fee of 83 pounds per household.

It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years--yet the BBC’s future is now in

doubt. The Corporation will survive as a publicly-funded broadcasting organization, at least

for the time being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the subject of a nationwide

debate in Britain.

The debate was launched by the Government, which invited anyone with an opinion of the

BBC-including ordinary listeners and viewers--to say what was good or bad about the

Corporation, and even whether they thought it was worth keeping. The reason for its inquiry

is that the BBC’s royal charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the

organization as it is, or to make changes.

Defenders of the Corporation-of whom there are many---are fond of quoting the American

slogan “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The BBC “ain’t broke”, they say, by which they mean it

"wares" and abilities must be displayed in an

change it?

Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world around it is changing.

The commercial TV channels---TV and Channel 4-were required by the Thatcher

Government’s Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each other for

advertisers, and cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival of new satellite channels--funded

partly by advertising and partly by viewers’ subscriptions-which will bring about the biggest

changes in the long term.

Passage 3

In the last half of the nineteenth century “capital” and “labour” were enlarging and

perfecting their rival organizations on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by a

limited liability company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. The change met the

technical requirements of the new age by engaging a large professional element and prevented

the decline in efficiency that so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms in the second

and third generation after the energetic founders. It was moreover a step away from individual

initiative, towards collectivism and municipal and state-owned business. The railway

companies, though still private business managed for the benefit of shareholders, were very

unlike old family business. At the same time the great municipalities went into business to

supply lighting, trams and other services to the taxpayers .

The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business had important

consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased

the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life

In the last half of the nineteenth century

“capital” and “labour” were enlarging and

commonly spoiled the fortunes of family

firms in the second and third generation after

the energetic founders. It was moreover a step

away from individual initiative, towards

collectivism and municipal and state-owned

business. The railway companies, though still

private business managed for the benefit of

shareholders, were very unlike old family

business. At the same time the great

municipalities went into business to supply

lighting, trams and other services to the

taxpayers .

The growth of the limited liability

company and municipal business had

important consequences. Such large,

impersonal manipulation of capital and

industry greatly increased the numbers and

importance of shareholders as a class, an

element in national life representing

irresponsible wealth detached from the land

and the duties of the landowners; and almost

equally detached from the responsible

management of business. All through the

nineteenth century, America, Africa, India,

Australia and parts of Europe were being

developed by British capital, and British

shareholders were thus enriched by the

world’s movement towards industrialisation.

Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country’s excellent elementary

schools; a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums to

inventors; and above all the American genius for nonverbal , “spatial” thinking about things

technological .

Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools our early mechanics

,especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, were generally literate and at

home in arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.

Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and inventiveness to this

educational advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 1853 reported,

“With a mind prepared by thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly into

the skilled workman.”

A further stimulus to invention came from the “premium” system, which preceded our patent

system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, originated abroad, offered inventors

medals, cash prizes and other incentives.

In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were awarded at country fairs

and at the industrial fairs in major cities. Americans flocked to these fairs to admire the new

machines and thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance.

Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the American worker took

readily to that special kind of nonverbal thinking required in mechanical technology. As

Eugene Ferguson has pointed out , “A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be

reduced to unambiguous verbal descriptions; they are dealt with in his mind by a visual,

nonverbal process . . . The designer and the inventor . . . are able to assemble and manipulate

in their minds devices that as yet do not exist.”

This nonverbal “spatial” thinking can be just as creative as painting and writing. Robert

Fulton once wrote, “The mechanic should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels,

etc., like a poet among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his

thoughts, in which a new arrangement transmits a new idea.”

When all these shaping forces--schools, open attitudes, the premium system, a genius for

spatial thinking--interacted with one another on the rich U. S. mainland, they produced that

American characteristic, emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But in earlier

times it meant a friendly but competitive striving for fame and excellence.

63. According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions in early America was in a

large part due to__

[A] elementary schools

528

[B] enthusiastic workers

[C] the attractive premium system

[D] a special way of thinking

This approach, originated abroad, offered

因是什么呢？

在诸多成因中，我想特别指出这个国

家优秀的基础教育、欢迎新技术的劳动大

军、奖励发明者的做法、最重要的是美国

人在处理技术性事物时天生具备的非语言

为什么要提小学教育？正是因为有了

这些学校，我们的早期技工才普遍能够读

是分不开的。正如1853 年访美的一个英国

访问团成员所报道的那样，“由于美国的孩

对发明创造的另一刺激因素来自“奖

不仅为发明者颁发奖章和奖金，也带来了

其他奖励。

open attitudes, the premium system, a genius

for spatial thinking--interacted with one

another on the rich U. S. mainland, they

produced that American characteristic,

emulation. Today that word implies mere

人类。

由于对这种对技术革新的乐观态度，

美国工人很快便接受了机械技术需要的那

种特殊的非语言的思维方式。正如尤金·弗

格森曾指出的那样：“技术人员思考的东西

是无法用明确的语言来表述的；这些东西

在他们的头脑中通过想象的、非语言性的

方式被处理加工……设计者和发明者……

能在头脑中组装和操作那些尚不存在的机

器。”

这种非语言的”“空间”思维方式与绘

画和写作一样具有创造性。罗伯特·法欧曾

写道：“技术人员坐在杠杆、螺钉、楔子、

轮子等东西中间，就如同一位诗人处在字

母表的字母之中，应该把它们看做是自己

思想的一种表达，其中每一个新的组合都

能传达一种新的想法。”

当所有这些因素——学校、开放的态

度、奖励制度及空间思维天赋——在富饶

的美国大陆上相互作用时，便造就了美国

人的特性：竞争。今天这个词仅意味着“模

仿”，但在早期美国，它却意味着为名誉和

出类拔萃而进行友好且激烈的竞争。

Passage 5

Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in the publisher’s

pipelines. A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused

and often unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific theories for

the origin and evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and biology have provided

a consistent , unified, and constantly improving account of what happened. "Scientific"

creationism, which is being pushed by some for “equal time” in the classrooms whenever the

scientific accounts of evolution are evil, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all

scientists and the majority of nonfunda mentalist religious leaders have come to regard

“scientific” creationism as bad science and bad religion.

The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At

appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. In

the last three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He

describes their programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists,

the extent of their deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. When their

basic motivation is religious, one might have expected more Christian behavior.

Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness of

his arguments. The nonspecialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and

argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the creationists will be

extremely clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen Jay Gould says: “This

book stands for reason itself.” And so it does-and all would be well were reason the only

judge in the creationism/evolution debate.

67. "Creationism" in the passage refers to__

[A] evolution in its true sense as to the origin of the universe

[B] a notion of the creation of religion

[C] the scientific explanation of the earth formation

[D] the deceptive theory about the origin of the universe

imitation. But in earlier times it meant a

68. Kitcher’s book is intended to __.

[A] recommend the views of the evolutionists

[B] expose the true features of creationists

[C] curse bitterly at this opponents

[D] launch a surprise attack on creationists

69 From the passage we can infer that__

[A] reasoning has played a decisive role in the debate

[B] creationists do not base their argument on reasoning

[C] evolutionary theory is too difficult for non-specialists

[D] creationism is supported by scientific findings

It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing

and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia’s Northern Territory became the

first legal authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who

wish to die. The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately

word flashed on the Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess,

executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group’s on line

service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: “We posted bulletins all day long, because of course this

isn’t just something that happened in Australia. It’s world history.”

The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally III law has

left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some

have breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right to life groups and the

Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste of its passage. But the

tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia — where an aging population, life extending

technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part — other states are

going to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US and Canada, where

the right to die movement is gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to

start falling.

Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death — probably by a

deadly injection or pill — to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as

terminally ill by two doctors. After a “cooling off” period of seven days, the patient can sign a

certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54

year old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally III law

means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death

from his breathing condition. “I’m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what

I was afraid of was how I’d go, because I’ve watched people die in the hospital fighting for

oxygen and clawing at their masks,” he says.

1. From the second paragraph we learn that _____.

[A] the objection to euthanasia is slow to come in other countries

[B] physicians and citizens share the same view on euthanasia

[C] changing technology is chiefly responsible for the hasty passage of the law

[D] it takes time to realize the significance of the law’s passage

2. When the author says that observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling, he means

_____.

536

[A] observers are taking a wait and see attitude towards the future of euthanasia

[B] similar bills are likely to be passed in the US, Canada and other countries

[C] observers are waiting to see the result of the game of dominoes

[D] the effect taking process of the passed bill may finally come to a stop

3. When Lloyd Nickson dies, he will _____.

[A] face his death with calm characteristic of euthanasia

[B] experience the suffering of a lung cancer patient

[C] have an intense fear of terrible suffering

[D] undergo a cooling off period of seven days

Passage 2

A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly, courteous, and

helpful most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of

Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course,

But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In

Australia — where an aging population, life

extending technology and changing

community attitudes have all played their part

— other states are going to consider making a

similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US

and Canada, where the right to die movement

is gathering strength, observers are waiting

for the dominoes to start falling.

Under the new Northern Territory law, an

adult patient can request death — probably

by a deadly injection or pill — to put an end

to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as

terminally ill by two doctors. After a “cooling

off” period of seven days, the patient can sign

a certificate of request. After 48 hours the

wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson,

a 54 year old Darwin resident suffering from

lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally III

law means he can get on with living without

the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying

death from his breathing condition. “I’m not

afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view,

but what I was afraid of was how I’d go,

because I’ve watched people die in the

hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at

their masks,” he says.

的作用。其他州也将考虑制定类似的法律

法规来处理安乐死问题。在美国和加拿大，

死亡权利运动正在积蓄力量积极准备。观

根据澳北州所通过的这项新法案，成

苦的煎熬。但此前病人必须经由两名医生

exceptions. Small minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly

unknown in the US. Yet it is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment.

For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break

in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the

families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome

sources of diversion, and brought news of the outside world.

The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone

traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin

or settlement. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable impulse on

the part of the settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: if you didn’t take in the stranger

and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might

be in the same situation.

Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the weary

traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US,

especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. “I was just

traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for

dinner — amazing.” Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but

are not always understood properly. The casual friendliness of many Americans should be

interpreted neither as superficial nor as artificial, but as the result of a historically developed

cultural tradition.

As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals,

assumptions, and conventions underlies all social interrelationships. And, of course, speaking

a language does not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns.

Visitors who fail to “translate” cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For

example, when an American uses the word “friend”, the cultural implications of the word

may be quite different from those it has in the visitor’s language and culture. It takes more

than a brief encounter on a bus to distinguish between courteous convention and individual

interest. Yet, being friendly is a virtue that many American value highly and expect from both

neighbors and strangers.

5. In the eyes of visitors from the outside world, _____.

[A]rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US

[B]small minded officials deserve a serious comment

[C]Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors

[D]most Americans are ready to offer help

540

6. It could be inferred from the last paragraph that _____.

[A]culture exercises an influence over social interrelationship

[B]courteous convention and individual interest are interrelated

[C]various virtues manifest themselves exclusively among friends

[D]social interrelationships equal the complex set of cultural conventions

7. Families in frontier settlements used to entertain strangers _____.

[A]to improve their hard life

[B]in view of their long distance travel

[C]to add some flavor to their own daily life

[D]out of a charitable impulse

8. The tradition of hospitality to strangers _____.

[B]is generally well kept up in the United States

[C]is always understood properly

Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or mental functioning is a

drug. Many people mistakenly believe the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine or

an illegal chemical taken by drug addicts. They don’t realize that familiar substances such as

alcohol and tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is now used

by many physicians and psychologists. The phrase “substance abuse” is often used instead of

“drug abuse” to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as

harmfully misused as heroin and cocaine.

We live a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances (drugs) is pervasive:

an aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a

cigarette for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently constructive uses

of a substance become misuses? First of all, most substances taken in excess will produce

negative effects such as poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a

substance can also lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence is marked

first by an increased tolerance, with more and more of the substance required to produce the

desired effect, and then by the appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the

substance is discontinued.

Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and

behavior are known as psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are commonly

grouped according to whether they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants

initially speed up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants slow it down.

Hallucinogens have their primary effect on perception, distorting and altering it in a variety of

ways including producing hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic

(from the Greek word meaning “mind-manifesting”) because they seemed to radically alter

one’s state of consciousness.

9. “Substance abuse” (Line 5, Paragraph 1) is preferable to “drug abuse” in that _____.

[A]substances can alter our bodily or mental functioning if illegally used

[B]“drug abuse” is only related to a limited number of drug takers

[C]alcohol and tobacco are as fatal as heroin and cocaine

[D]many substances other than heroin or cocaine can also be poisonous

10. The word “pervasive” (Line 1, Paragraph 2) might mean _____.

[A]widespread

[B]overwhelming

[C]piercing

544

[D]fashionable

11. Physical dependence on certain substances results from _____.

[A]uncontrolled consumption of them over long periods of time

[B]exclusive use of them for social purposes

[C]quantitative application of them to the treatment of diseases

[D]careless employment of them for unpleasant symptoms

12. From the last paragraph we can infer that _____.

[A]stimulants function positively on the mind

[B]hallucinogens are in themselves harmful to health

[C]depressants are the worst type of psychoactive substances

[D]the three types of psychoactive substances are commonly used in groups

No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral decline of a nation. “Is this what

you intended to accomplish with your careers?” Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner

executives last week. “You have sold your souls, but must you corrupt our nation and threaten

our children as well?” At Time Warner, however, such questions are simply the latest

manifestation of the soul searching that has involved the company ever since the company

was born in 1990. It’s a self-examination that has, at various times, involved issues of

responsibility, creative freedom and the corporate bottom line.

At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who took over for the late Steve

Ross in 1992. On the financial front, Levin is under pressure to raise the stock price and

reduce the company’s mountainous debt, which will increase to 17.3 billion after two new

cable deals close. He has promised to sell off some of the property and restructure the

company, but investors are waiting impatiently.

The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin has consistently defended the

company’s rap music on the grounds of expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under

fire for releasing Ice T’s violent rap song Cop Killer, Levin described rap as a lawful

expression of street culture, which deserves an outlet. “The test of any democratic society,” he

wrote in a Wall Street Journal column, “lies not in how well it can control expression but in

whether it gives freedom of thought and expression the widest possible latitude, however

disputable or irritating the results may sometimes be. We won’t retreat in the face of any

threats.”

Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were signs that the chairman

was backing off his hard line stand, at least to some extent. During the discussion of rock

singing verses at last month’s stockholders’ meeting, Levin asserted that “music is not the

cause of society’s ills” and even cited his son, a teacher in the Bronx, New York, who uses

rap to communicate with students. But he talked as well about the “balanced struggle”

between creative freedom and social responsibility, and he announced that the company

would launch a drive to develop standards for distribution and labeling of potentially

objectionable music.

The 15 member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin and his corporate

strategy. But insiders say several of them have shown their concerns in this matter. “Some of

us have known for many, many years that the freedoms under the First Amendment are not

totally unlimited,” says Luce. “I think it is perhaps the case that some people associated with

the company have only recently come to realize this.”

[D]received more support from the 15 member board

Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as “steering the economy to a

soft landing” or “a touch on the brakes”, makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could

be further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain. And there

are long, variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the

analogy that likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened

windscreen, a cracked rear view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.

Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of late.

Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to

its lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way below

the double digit rates which many countries experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s.

It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists

which The Economist polls each month said that America’s inflation rate would average 3.5%

in 1995. In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and expected to average only about 3% for the year

as a whole. In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point below the rate

predicted at the end of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years,

inflation has been consistently lower than expected in Britain and America.

Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and

the United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially

America’s, have little productive slack. America’s capacity utilization, for example, his

historically high levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen bellow

most estimates of the natural rate of unemployment — the rate below which inflation has

taken off in the past.

Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a little

defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have up

ended the old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and

inflation.

17. From the passage we learn that ____.

[A]there is a definite relationship between inflation and interest rates

[B]economy will always follow certain models

[C]the economic situation is better than expected

[D]economists had foreseen the present economic situation

18. According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?

[A]Making monetary policies is comparable to driving a car

**1998**年研究生入学考试英语阅读理解**A**

Passage 1

Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is

humankind’s long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the ideal of forcing

the waters to do our bidding so fascination. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be

blind. Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good.

The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn’t help that building a big,

powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to assert

themselves. Egypt’s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam.

Turkey’s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.

But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example, stopped the Nile

flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left - all in return for a giant reservoir

of disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.

And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized

Europe, Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their contention

over a dam on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of

big dams. But Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs a dam to

prove itself.

Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go ahead to the even more wrong

headed Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will

cause hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the

powerful, but they are far from guaranteed.

Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of controlling

water can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation

are possible without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it is hard

to be either proper, or scientific. It is time that the world learned the lessons of Aswan. You

don’t need a dam to be saved.

1. The third sentence of paragraph 1 implies that _____ .

[A] people would be happy if they shut their eyes to reality

[B] the blind could be happier than the sighted

[C] over-excited people tend to neglect vital things.

[D] fascination makes people lose their eyesight

2. In paragraph 5, “the powerless” probably refers to _____ .

[A] areas short of electricity

[B] dams without power stations

[C] poor countries around India

[D] common people in the Narmada Dam area

3. What is the myth concerning giant dams?

[A] They bring in more fertile soil.

[B] They help defend the country.

[C] They strengthen international ties.

[D] They have universal control of the waters.

4. What the author tries to suggest may best be interpreted as _____ .

Passage 2

Well, no gain without pain, they say. But what about pain without gain? Everywhere you

go in America, you hear tales of corporate revival. What is harder to establish is whether the

productivity revolution that businessmen assume they are presiding over is for real.

The official statistics are mildly discouraging. They show that, if you lump manufacturing

and services together, productivity has grown on average by 1.2% since 1987. That is

somewhat faster than the average during the previous decade. And since 1991, productivity

has increased by about 2% a year, which is more than twice the 1978 87 average. The trouble

is that part of the recent acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this point in a

business cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying trend. There is,

as Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, says, a “disjunction” between the mass of business

anecdote that points to a leap in productivity and the picture reflected by the statistics.

Some of this can be easily explained. New ways of organizing the workplace all that re

and now needs a dam to prove itself.

Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has

given the go ahead to the even more wrong

headed Narmada Dam. And the bank has

done this even though its advisors say the

engineering and downsizing - are only one contribution to the overall productivity of an

economy, which is driven by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment and

machinery, new technology, and investment in education and training. Moreover, most of the

changes that companies make are intended to keep them profitable, and this need not always

mean increasing productivity: switching to new markets or improving quality can matter just

as much.

Two other explanations are more speculative. First, some of the business restructuring of

recent years may have been ineptly done. Second, even if it was well done, it may have

spread much less widely than people suppose.

Leonard Schlesinger, a Harvard academic and former chief executive of Au Bong Pain, a

rapidly growing chain of bakery cafes, says that much “re engineering” has been crude. In

many cases, he believes, the loss of revenue has been greater than the reductions in cost. His

colleague, Michael Beer, says that far too many companies have applied re engineering in a

mechanistic fashion, chopping out costs without giving sufficient thought to long term

profitability. BBDO’s Al Rosenshine is blunter. He dismisses a lot of the work of re

engineering consultants as mere rubbish - “the worst sort of ambulance cashing.”

Passage 3

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of

Gallileo’s 17th century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet

William Blake’s harsh remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The

schism between science and the humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.

Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore its

critics - but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have attacked

“antiscience” in several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R.Gross, a biologist at

the University of Verginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers University; and

The Demon Haunted World, by Car Sagan of Cornell University.

Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as “The Flight from

and former chief executive of Au Bong Pain,

Science and Reason,” held in New York City in 1995, and “Science in the Age of

(Mis)information,” which assembled last June near Buffalo.

Antiscience clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find fault

primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned science’s

objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other

phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.

A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the antiscience tag has been attached to many

other groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last remaining

stocks of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.

Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, those manifesto, published in

1995, scorns science and longs for return to a pretechnological utopia. But surely that does

not mean environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are antiscience,

as an essay in US News & World Report last May seemed to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science,

argues Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who

question the evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other

consequences of industrial growth.

Indeed, some observers fear that the antiscience epithet is in danger of becoming

meaningless. “The term ‘antiscience’ can lump together too many, quite different things,”

notes Harvard University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science and Anti

Science. “They have in common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who

regard themselves as more enlightened.”

**[**全文译文**]**

Science has long had an uneasy

relationship with other aspects of culture.

Think of Gallileo’s 17th century trial for his

rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or

poet William Blake’s harsh remarks against

the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton.

The schism between science and the

humanities has, if anything, deepened in this

century.

Until recently, the scientific community

was so powerful that it could afford to ignore

its critics - but no longer. As funding for

science has declined, scientists have attacked

“antiscience” in several books, notably

Higher Superstition, by Paul R.Gross, a

biologist at the University of Verginia, and

Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers

University; and The Demon Haunted World,

by Car Sagan of Cornell University.

Defenders of science have also voiced their

concerns at meetings such as “The Flight

from Science and Reason,” held in New York

City in 1995, and “Science in the Age of

(Mis)information,” which assembled last June

near Buffalo.

Antiscience clearly means different things

科学与文化的其他方面的关系一直都

science’s objectivity. Sagan is more

concerned with those who believe in ghosts,

creationism and other phenomena that

contradict the scientific worldview.

A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals

that the antiscience tag has been attached to

many other groups as well, from authorities

who advocated the elimination of the last

remaining stocks of smallpox virus to

Republicans who advocated decreased

funding for basic research.

Few would dispute that the term applies to

the Unabomber, those manifesto, published in

1995, scorns science and longs for return to a

pretechnological utopia. But surely that does

not mean environmentalists concerned about

uncontrolled industrial growth are antiscience,

as an essay in US News & World Report last

May seemed to suggest.

The environmentalists, inevitably, respond

to such critics. The true enemies of science,

argues Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a

pioneer of environmental studies, are those

who question the evidence supporting global

warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and

other consequences of industrial growth.

Indeed, some observers fear that the

antiscience epithet is in danger of becoming

meaningless. “The term ‘antiscience’ can

Passage 4

Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing more and more

regional competition, as population growth in the Northeast and Midwest reaches a near

standstill.

This development - and its strong implications for US politics and economy in years ahead

- has enthroned the South as America’s most densely populated region for the first time in the

history of the nation’s head counting.

Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million people - numerically the

third largest growth ever recorded in a single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4

percent, lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.

Americans have been migrating south and west in larger number since World War II, and

the pattern still prevails.

Three sun belt states - Florida, Texas and California - together had nearly 10 million more

people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th

and San Antonio from 15th to 10th - with Cleveland and Washington.DC, dropping out of the

top 10.

Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow belt, census officials

say, Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too - and so did bigger crops of babies as

yesterday’s “baby boom” generation reached its child bearing years.

Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a related but

newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for places

with more jobs but with fewer people, too. Some instances-

● Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid growth rate -

37.1 percent since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population.

●Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1 percent

respectively. Except fro Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is composed of

Western states with 7.5 million people - about 9 per square mile.

climates.

Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious living

than in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, more

than any other state.

In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, mostly to other parts

of the West. Often they chose - and still are choosing - somewhat colder climates such as

Oregon, Idaho and Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization in

the Golden State.

As a result, California’s growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 18.5 percent - little more

than two thirds the 1960s’ growth figure and considerably below that of other Western states.

13. Discerned from the perplexing picture of population growth the 1980 census provided,

America in 1970s _____.

[A] enjoyed the lowest net growth of population in history

[B] witnessed a southwestern shift of population

[C] underwent an unparalleled period of population growth

[D] brought to a standstill its pattern of migration since World War II

14. The census distinguished itself from previous studies on population movement in that

_____ .

[A] it stresses the climatic influence on population distribution

[B] it highlights the contribution of continuous waves of immigrants

[C] it reveals the Americans’ new pursuit of spacious living

[D] it elaborates the delayed effects of yesterday’s “baby boom”

15. We can see from the available statistics that _____ .

[A] California was once the most thinly populated area in the whole US

[B] the top 10 states in growth rate of population were all located in the West

[C] cities with better climates benefited unanimously from migration

[D] Arizona ranked second of all states in its growth rate of population

16. The word “demographers” (Line 1, Paragraph 8) most probably means _____ .

[A] people in favor of the trend of democracy

[B] advocates of migration between states

[C] scientists engaged in the study of population

569

[D] conservatives clinging to old patterns of life

Passage 5

Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity

known to geologists as hot spots. Unlike most of the world’s volcanoes, they are not always

found at the boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up the earth’s surface; on the

contrary, many of them lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the hot spots move only

slowly, and in some cases the movement of the plates past them has left trails of dead

volcanoes. The hot spots and their volcanic trails are milestones that mark the passage of the

plates.

That the plates are moving is not beyond dispute. Africa and South America, for example,

are moving away from each other as new material is injected into the sea floor between them.

The complementary coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the ocean are

reminders of where the two continents were once joined. The relative motion of the plates

carrying these continents has been constructed in detail, but the motion of one plate with

respect to another cannot readily be translated into motion with respect to the earth’s interior.

It is not possible to determine whether both continents are moving in opposite directions or

whether one continent is stationary and the other is drifting away from it. Hot spots, anchored

in the deeper layers of the earth, provide the measuring instruments needed to resolve the

question. From an analysis of the hot spot population it appears that the African plate is

stationary and that it has not moved during the past 30 million years.

The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role as a frame of reference. It now

appears that they also have an important influence on the geophysical processes that propel

the plates across the globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, the material

rising from deeper layer creates a broad dome. As the dome grows, it develops seed fissures

(cracks); in at least a few cases the continent may break entirely along some of these fissures,

so that the hot spot initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus just as earlier theories have

explained the mobility of the continents, so hot spots may explain their mutability

(inconstancy).

17. The author believes that _____ .

[A] the motion of the plates corresponds to that of the earth’s interior

[B] the geological theory about drifting plates has been proved to be true

[C] the hot spots and the plates move slowly in opposite directions

[D] the movement of hot spots proves the continents are moving apart

18. That Africa and South America were once joined can be deduced from the fact that _____

.

[A] the two continents are still moving in opposite directions

[B] they have been found to share certain geological features

[C] the African plates has been stable for 30 million years

[D] over 100 hot spots are scattered all around the globe

19. The hot spot theory may prove useful in explaining _____ .

[A] the structure of the African plates

[B] the revival of dead volcanoes

[C] the mobility of the continents

[D] the formation of new oceans

20. The passage is mainly about _____ .

Passage l

It’s a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a leg slipping on your

doormat. Light up the stove and you could burn down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or

stove failed to warn of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for your

troubles. Or so the thinking has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began holding more

companies liable for their customers’ misfortunes.

Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to

anticipate every possible accident. Today, stepladders carry labels several inches long that

warn, among other things, that you might-surprise! --fall off. The label on a child’s Batman

cape cautions that the toy "does not enable user to fly."

While warnings are often appropriate and necessary--the dangers of drug interactions, for

example--and many are required by state or federal regulations, it isn’t clear that they actually

protect the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. About 50 percent

of the companies lose when injured customers take them to court.

Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue as before, some

courts are beginning to side with defendants, especially in cases where a warning label

probably wouldn’t have changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt Sports

in Illinois, successfully fought a lawsuit involving a football player who was paralyzed in a

game while wearing a Schutt helmet. "We’re really sorry he has become paralyzed, but

helmets aren’t designed to prevent those kinds of injuries, "says Nimmons. The jury agreed

that the nature of the game, not the helmet, was the reason for the athlete’s injury. At the same

time, the American Law Institute--a group of judges, lawyers, and academics whose

recommendations carry substantial weight-issued new guidelines for tort law stating that

577

companies need not warn customers of obvious dangers or bombard them with a lengthy list

of possible ones. "Important information can get buried in a sea of trivialities," says a law

professor at Cornell law School who helped draft the new guidelines. If the moderate end of

the legal community has its way, the information on products might actually be provided for

the benefit of customers and not as protection against legal liability.

51. What were things like in 1980s when accidents happened?

[A] Customers might be relieved of their disasters through lawsuits.

[B] Injured customers could expect protection from the legal system.

[C] Companies would avoid being sued by providing new warnings.

[D] Juries tended to find fault with the compensations companies promised.

52. Manufacturers as mentioned in the passage tend to__

[A] satisfy customers by writing long warnings on products

[B] become honest in describing the inadequacies of their products

[C] make the best use of labels to avoid legal liability

[D] feel obliged to view customers’ safety as their first concern

53. The case of Schutt helmet demonstrated that__

[A] some injury claims were no longer supported by law

[B] helmets were not designed to prevent injuries

[C] product labels would eventually be discarded

[D] some sports games might lose popularity with athletes

personal injury claims continue as before,

some courts are beginning to side with

defendants, especially in cases where a

warning label probably wouldn’t have

changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons,

president of Schutt Sports in Illinois,

successfully fought a lawsuit involving a

football player who was paralyzed in a game

while wearing a Schutt helmet. "We’re really

sorry he has become paralyzed, but helmets

aren’t designed to prevent those kinds of

injuries, "says Nimmons. The jury agreed that

the nature of the game, not the helmet, was

the reason for the athlete’s injury. At the

same time, the American Law Institute--a

group of judges, lawyers, and academics

whose recommendations carry substantial

weight-issued new guidelines for tort law

stating that companies need not warn

customers of obvious dangers or bombard

them with a lengthy list of possible ones.

"Important information can get buried in a sea

of trivialities," says a law professor at Cornell

law School who helped draft the new

guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal

community has its way, the information on

products might actually be provided for the

benefit of customers and not as protection

，但是如果消费者受伤，这些警示语能否

真正使制造商和销售商免于责任，这还很

难说。当受伤的消费者把公司告上法庭后，

大约一半的结果是公司败诉。

现在看来这种趋势正在转变。尽管个

人伤害的指控一如既往还在继续，但有些

法庭已开始站到被告一方，特别是在处理

那些即使有警示语也无法避免伤害的案件

时。五月份，伊利诺斯州的Shutt 体育公司

总裁朱利·尼蒙斯就成功地打赢了这样一场

官司。一名橄榄球队员戴着该公司的头盔

在一场比赛中受伤瘫痪，遂将该公司告上

法庭。公司总裁朱利·尼蒙斯争辩说：“他的

Passage 2

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to tap

the consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies

have started to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such business-to-business

sales make sense because businesspeople typically know what product they’re looking for.

Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its

reliability. "Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them and the

supplier," says senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are

limiting the risk by conducting online transactions only with established business partners

who are given access to the company’ s private internet .

Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available

for marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to "pull"

customers into sites. In the past year, however, software companies have developed tools that

allow companies to "push" information directly out to consumers, transmitting marketing

messages directly to targeted customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen

saver to deliver a continually updated stream of news and advertisements to subscribers’

computer monitors. Subscribers can customize the information they want to receive and

proceed directly to a company’s Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are already

starting to use similar technologies to push messages to customers about special sales, product

offerings, or other events. But push technology has earned the contempt of many Web users.

Online culture thinks highly of the notion that the information flowing onto the screen comes

there by specific request. Once commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the

distinction between the Web and television fades. That’s a prospect that horrifies Net purists.

But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies

to make money. The examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show

that a Web site selling the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, hospitality,

and security will attract online customers. And the cost of computing power continues to free

fall, which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon. People looking back 5

or 10 years from now may well wonder why so few companies took the online plunge.

Passage 3

An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the classroom on the behalf of

students’ career prospects and those arguing for computers in the classroom for broader

reasons of radical educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have explored this

distinction-indeed, contradiction--which goes to the heart of what is wrong with the campaign

to put computers in the classroom.

An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of job is a technical education,

justified for reasons radically different from why education is universally required by law. It

is not simply to raise everyone’s job prospects that all children are legally required to attend

school into their teens. Rather, we have a certain conception of the American citizen, a

character who is incomplete if he cannot competently assess how his livelihood and happiness

are affected by things outside of himself. But this was not always the case; before it was

legally required for all children to attend school until a certain age, it was widely accepted

that some were just not equipped by nature to pursue this kind of education. With optimism

characteristic of all industrialized countries, we came to accept that everyone is fit to be

educated. Computer-education advocates forsake this optimistic notion for a pessimism that

betrays their otherwise cheery outlook. Banking on the confusion between educational and

vocational reasons for bringing computers into schools, computer-ed advocates often

emphasize the job prospects of graduates over their educational achievement.

There are some good arguments for a technical education given the right kind of student.

Many European schools introduce the concept of professional training early on in order to

make sure children are properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It is, however,

presumptuous to insist that there will only be so many jobs for so many scientists, so many

businessmen, so many accountants. Besides, this is unlikely to produce the needed number of

every kind of professional in a country as large as ours and where the economy is spread over

so many states and involves so many international corporations.

But, for a small group of students, professional training might be the way to go since welldeveloped

skills, all other factors being equal , can be the difference between having a job and

not. Of course, the basics of using any computer these days are very simple. It does not take a

lifelong acquaintance to pick up various software programs. If one wanted to become a

computer engineer, that is, of course, an entirely different story. Basic computer skills take--at

585

the very longest-a couple of months to learn. In any case, basic computer skills are only

complementary to the host of real skills that are necessary to becoming any kind of

professional. It should be observed, of course, that no school, vocational or not, is helped by a

confusion over its purpose.

59. The author thinks the present rush to put computers in the classroom is__

[A] far-reaching

[B] dubiously oriented

[C] self-contradictory

[D] radically reformatory

60. The belief that education is indispensable to all children__

[A] is indicative of a pessimism in disguise

[B] came into being along with the arrival of computers

[C] is deeply rooted in the minds of computer-ed advocates

[D]originated from the optimistic attitude of industrialized countries

61. It could be inferred from the passage that in the author’ s country the European model of

professional training is__

[A] dependent upon the starting age of candidates

[B] worth trying in various social sections

[C] of little practical value

[D] attractive to every kind of professional

62. According to the author, basic computer skills should be__

[A] included as an auxiliary course in school

[B] highlighted in acquisition of professional qualifications

[C]mastered through a life-long course

[D] equally emphasized by any school , vocational or otherwise

Passage 4

When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months ago that it had

cloned an adult sheep, President Clinton moved swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to

using this unusual animal husbandry technique to clone humans, he ordered that federal funds

not be used for such an experiment-although no one had proposed to do so--and asked an

independent panel of experts chaired by Princeton President Harold Shapiro to report back to

the White House in 90 days with recommendations for a national policy on human cloning.

That group--the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC)-has been working

feverishly to put its wisdom on paper, and at a meeting on 17 May, members agreed on a

near-final draft of their recommendations.

NBAC will ask that Clinton’s 90-day ban on federal funds for human cloning be extended

where the economy is spread over so many

states and involves so many international

corporations.

But, for a small group of students,

indefinitely and possibly that it be made law. But NBAC members are planning to word the

recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research that involves the cloning of

human DNA or cells-routine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet reached agreement

on a crucial question, however, whether to recommend legislation that would make it a crime

for private funding to be used for human cloning.

In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro

suggested that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be "morally unacceptable

to attempt to create a human child by adult nuclear cloning." Shapiro explained during the

meeting that the moral doubt stems mainly from fears about the risk to the health of the child.

The panel then informally accepted several general conclusions, although some details have

not been settled.

NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government funding for any attempt to

clone body cell nuclei to create a child. Because current federal law already forbids the use of

federal funds to create embryos ( the earliest stage of human offspring before birth) for

research or to knowingly endanger an embryo’ s life, NBAC will remain silent on embryo

research.

NBAC members also indicated that they will appeal to privately funded researchers and

clinics not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were divided on

whether to go further by calling for a federal law that would impose a complete ban on human

cloning. Shapiro and most members favored an appeal for such legislation, but in a phone

interview, he said this issue was still "up in the air."

63. We can learn from the first paragraph that__

[A] federal funds have been used in a project to clone humans

[B] the White House responded strongly to the news of cloning

[C] NBAC was authorized to control the misuse of cloning technique

[D] the White House has got the panel’s recommendations on cloning

64. The panel agreed on all of the following except that__

[A] the ban on federal funds for human cloning should be made a law

[B] the cloning of human DNA is not to be put under more control

[C] it is criminal to use private funding for human cloning

[D] it would be against ethical values to clone a human being

[D]the issue is explicitly stated and settled in the law

66. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that__

Passage 5

Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it prepares than on the

preparedness of the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton

supposedly discovered gravity through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in many

places for centuries and thousands of people had seen them fall. But Newton for years had

been curious about the cause of the orbital motion of the moon and planets. What kept them

in place? Why didn’t they fall out of the sky? The fact that the apple fell down toward the

earth and not up into the tree answered the question he had been asking himself about those

lager fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.

How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the tree?

Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind

was ready for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research. If

you don’t have unpredictable things, you don’t have research. Scientists tend to forget this

when writing their cut and dried reports for the technical journals, but history is filled with

examples of it.

In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression

that they find the "scientific method" a substitute for imaginative thought. I’ve attended

research conferences where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the advisability of

continuing a certain experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at the graphs, and said "the

data are still inconclusive." "We know that," the men from the budget office have said, "but

what do you think? Is it worthwhile going on? What do you think we might expect?" The

scientist has been shocked at having even been asked to speculate.

What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the victim of his own

writings. He has put forward unquestioned claims so consistently that he not only believes

them himself, but has convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If

experiments are planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the

science journals indicate, then it is perfectly logical for management to expect research to

produce results measurable in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable for auditors to

believe that scientists who know exactly where they are going and how they will get there

should not be distracted by the necessity of keeping one eye on the cash register while the

other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as

desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect , is management

594

to be blamed for discriminating against the "odd balls among researchers in favor of more

conventional thinkers who "work well with the team. "

67. The author wants to prove with the example of Isaac Newton that __

[A] inquiring minds are more important than scientific experiments

[B] science advances when fruitful researches are conducted

[C] scientists seldom forget the essential nature of research

[D] unpredictability weighs less than prediction in scientific research

68. The author asserts that scientists __

[A] shouldn’t replace "scientific method" with imaginative thought

[B] shouldn’t neglect to speculate on unpredictable things

[C] should write more concise reports for technical journals

[D]should be confident about their research findings

69. It seems that some young scientists__

[A] have a keen interest in prediction

[B] often speculate on the future

[C] think highly of creative thinking

[D] stick to "scientific method"

70. The author implies that the results of scientific research__

[A] may not be as profitable as they are expected

[B] can be measured in dollars and cents

[C] rely on conformity to a standard pattern

Passage 1

A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly handled,

it may become a driving force. When the United States entered just such a glowing period

after the end of the Second World War, it had a market eight ties larger than any competitor,

giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale. Its scientists were the world’s best, its

workers the most skilled. America and Americans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the

Europeans and Asians whose economies the war had destroyed.

It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other countries grew richer.

Just as inevitably, the retreat from predominance proved painful. By the mid-1980s

Americans had found themselves at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. Some

huge American industries, such as consumer electronics, had shrunk or vanished in the face of

foreign competition. By 1987 there was only one American television maker left,

Zenith.(Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South Korea’s LG Electronics in

July.)Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into the domestic market America’s

machine-tool industry was on the ropes. For a while it looked as though the making of

semiconductors, which America had invented and which sat at the heart of the new computer

age, was going to be the next casualty.

All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking prosperity for granted.

They began to believe that their way of doing business was failing, and that their incomes

would therefore shortly begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after another

into the causes of America’s industrial decline. Their sometimes sensational findings were

filled with warnings about the growing competition from overseas.

How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on five years of solid

growth while Japan has been struggling. Few Americans attribute this solely to such obvious

scientist as the writing of his papers would

appear to reflect , is management to be

blamed for discriminating against the "odd

Washington, DC. And William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School believes that people

will look back on this period as" a golden age of business management in the United States."

51. The U.S.achieved its predominance after World War Ⅱbecause_____ .

[A] it had made painstaking efforts towards this goal

[B] its domestic market was eight times larger than before

[C] the war had destroyed the economies of most potential competitors

[D] the unparalleled size of its workforce had given an impetus to its economy

52.The loss of U.S. predominance in the world economy in the 1980s is manifested in the fact

that the American_____.

[A] TV industry had withdrawn to its domestic market

[B] semiconductor industry had been taken over by foreign enterprises

[C] machine-tool industry had collapsed after suicidal actions

[D] auto industry had lost part of its domestic market

53.What can be inferred from the passage?

[A] It is human nature to shift between self-doubt and blind pried.

[B] Intense competition may contribute to economic progress.

[C] The revival of the economy depends on international cooperation.

[D] A long history of success may pave the way for further development.

Passage 2

Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males born for every 100

females, but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds

there are twice as many women as men. But the great universal of male mortality is being

changed. Now, by babies survive almost as well as girls do. This means that, for the first time,

there will be an excess of boys in those crucial years when they are searching for a mate.

More important, another chance for natural selection has been removed. Fifty years ago, the

chance of a baby (particularly a boy baby) surviving depended on its weight. A kilogram too

light or too heavy meant almost certain death. Today it makes almost no difference. Since

much of the variation is due to genes one more agent of evolution has gone.

There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but have fewer children.

Few people are as fertile as in the past. Except in some religious communities, very few

women has 15 children. Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death, has become

average. Most of us have roughly the same number of offspring. Again, differences between

people and the opportunity for natural selection to take advantage of it have diminished. India

shows what is happening. The country offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty

for the remaining tribal peoples. The grand mediocrity of today everyone being the same in

survival and number of offspring means that natural selection has lost 80% of its power in

upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes.

For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived. Strangely, it has

involved little physical change No other species fills so many places in nature. But in the past

100,000 years –even the past 100 years—our lives have been transformed but our bodies have

not. We did not evolve, because machines and society did it for us. Darwin had a phrase to

Government," It makes me proud to be an

American just to see how our businesses are

improving their productivity, says Stephen

Moore of the Cato Institute, a think-tank in

Washington, DC. And William Sahlman of

golden age of business management in the

describe those ignorant of evolution: they "look at an organic being as average looks at a ship,

as at something wholly beyond his comprehension." No doubt we will remember a 20th

century way of life beyond comprehension for its ugliness. But however amazed our

descendants may be at how far from Utopia we were, they will look just like us.

55. What used to be the danger in being a man according to the first paragraph?

[A] A lack of mates.

[B] A fierce competition.

[C] A lower survival rate.

[D] A defective gene.

56. What does the example of India illustrate?

[A] Wealthy people tend to have fewer children than poor people.

[B] Natural selection hardly works among the rich and the poor.

[C] The middle class population is 80% smaller than that of the tribes.

[D] India is one of the countries with a very high birth rate.

57. The author argues that our bodies have stopped evolving because____ .

[A] life has been improved by technological advance

[B] the number of female babies has been declining

[C] our species has reached the highest stage of evolution

[D] the difference between wealth and poverty is disappearing

58.Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?

Passage 3

When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its

advocates are aiming at, for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles may seem

today, it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. With regard to

Futurist poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist poetry may be even

admitting that the theory on which it is based may be right, it can hardly be classed as

Literature.

This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for a noise and violence and speed. Consequently,

our feelings, thoughts and emotions have undergone a corresponding change. This speeding

up of life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression. We must speed up our

literature too, if we want to interpret modern stress. We must pour out a large stream of

essential words, unhampered by stops, or qualifying adjectives, of finite verbs. Instead of

describing sounds we must make up words that imitate them; we must use many sizes of type

and different colored inks on the same page, and shorten or lengthen words at will.

Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little upsetting to read in the

explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian

officer on a bridge off which they both fall into the river and then to find that the line consists

of the noise of their falling and the weights of the officers:’ Pluff! Pluff! A hundred and

eighty-five kilograms.’

This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be classed

as Literature. All the same, no thinking man can refuse to accept their first proposition: that a

great change in our emotional life calls for a change of expression. The whole question is

really this: have we essentially changed?

59. This passage is mainly____.

[A] a survey of new approaches to art

[B] a review of Futurist poetry

[C] about merits of the Futurist movement

[D] about laws and requirements of literature

60.When a novel literary idea appears, people should try to_____.

[A] determine its purposes

606

[B] ignore its flaws

[C] follow the new fashions

[D] accept the principles

61.Futurists claim that we must____.

[A] increase the production of literature

[B] use poetry to relieve modern stress

[C] develop new modes of expression

[D] avoid using adjectives and verbs

62.The author believes that Futurist poetry is_____.

**[**全文译文**]**

When a new movement in art attains a

certain fashion, it is advisable to find out

what its advocates are aiming at, for, however

farfetched and unreasonable their principles

may seem today, it is possible that in years to

come they may be regarded as normal. With

regard to Futurist poetry, however, the case is

rather difficult, for whatever Futurist poetry

may be even admitting that the theory on

which it is based may be right, it can hardly

be classed as Literature.

This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for

a noise and violence and speed. Consequently,

our feelings, thoughts and emotions have

undergone a corresponding change. This

speeding up of life, says the Futurist, requires

a new form of expression. We must speed up

our literature too, if we want to interpret

modern stress. We must pour out a large

stream of essential words, unhampered by

stops, or qualifying adjectives, of finite verbs.

Instead of describing sounds we must make

up words that imitate them; we must use

当一场新的艺术运动形成某种时尚时，

理应弄清其倡导者的目标所在，因为无论

他们的主张在今天看来是多么牵强附会、

不可思议，将来都有可能被视为正常的。

然而，就未来派诗歌而言，情况却相当不

同，因为无论未来派诗歌为什么——即使

承认其理论根据可能正确——也很难称之

为文学。

简而言之，未来派诗人宣称：一个世

纪以来，过去的生活一直在有条件地急剧

变化。现在，我们生活在一个充斥着喧嚣、

暴力和快节奏的世界之中。因此，我们的

感情、思想和情绪都经历了相应的变化。

未来派诗人声称，这种加速的生活节奏需

要一种新的表达形式。如果我们想诠释现

代生活的压力，就必须加快文学发展的步

伐。我们必须大量使用基本词汇，摆脱句

Passage 4

Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social

harmony are the envy of the United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are

seeing a decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were

hardworking and saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely

fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don’t know where they should go next.

The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the maledominated

job market have limited the opportunities of teen-agers who are already

questioning the heavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan’s rigid social ladder to

good schools and jobs. In a recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese

students were fully satisfied with school life, compared with 67.2 percent of students in the

United States. In addition, far more Japanese workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs

many sizes of type and different colored inks

on the same page, and shorten or lengthen

words at will.

Certainly their descriptions of battles are

confused. But it is a little upsetting to read in

the explanatory notes that a certain line

describes a fight between a Turkish and a

Bulgarian officer on a bridge off which they

both fall into the river and then to find that

the line consists of the noise of their falling

and the weights of the officers:’ Pluff! Pluff!

A hundred and eighty-five kilograms.’

This, though it fulfills the laws and

requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be

classed as Literature. All the same, no

thinking man can refuse to accept their first

proposition: that a great change in our

emotional life calls for a change of

expression. The whole question is really this:

have we essentially changed?

While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends

to stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression." Those

things that do not show up in the test scores personality, ability, courage or humanity are

completely ignored," says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s

119 million citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have been

abandoned in favor of isolated, two generation households. Urban Japanese have long

endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work) and crowded living conditions, but as

the old group and family values weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade,

the Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that of the United States, has increased by

more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by nearly one-quarter.

[A] they think of it as immoral

[C] ambition is not closely related to material benefits

[D] they do not want to appear greedy and contemptible

Passage 1

Specialisation can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of

scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units, one man could

continue to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But

specialisation was only one of a series of related developments in science affecting the

process of communication. Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific activity.

No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science:

exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word 'amateur' does carry a

connotation that the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific community and,

in particular, may not fully share its values. The growth of specialisation in the nineteenth

century, with its consequent requirement of a longer, more complex training, implied greater

problems for amateur participation in science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those

areas of science based especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be

illustrated in terms of the development of geology in the United Kingdom.

A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not

simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of

what constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local

geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth

century, local studies have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they

incorporate, and reflect on, the wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have

continued to pursue local studies in the old way. The overall result has been to make entrance

618

to professional geological journals harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by

the widespread introduction of refereeing, first by national journals in the nineteenth century

and then by several local geological journals in the twentieth century. As a logical

consequence of this development, separate journals have now appeared aimed mainly towards

either professional or amateur readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to

professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two specific societies,

whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in local societies or to come together

nationally in a different way.

Although the process of professionalisation and specialisation was already well under way

in British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed until

the twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned

as the crucial period for this change in the structure of science.

51. The growth of specialisation in the 19th century might be more clearly seen in sciences

such as ________.

[A] sociology and chemistry

[B] physics and psychology

[C] sociology and psychology

[D] physics and chemistry

52. We can infer from the passage that ________.

[A] there is little distinction between specialisation and professionalisation

[B] amateurs can compete with professionals in some areas of science

[C] professionals tend to welcome amateurs into the scientific community

[D] amateurs have national academic societies but no local ones

53. The author writes of the development of geology to demonstrate ________.

[A] the process of specialisation and professionalisation

[B] the hardship of amateurs in scientific study

[C] the change of policies in scientific publications

[D] the discrimination of professionals against amateurs

54. The direct reason for specialisation is ________.

Passage 2

A great deal of attention is being paid today to the so called digital divide-the division of

the world into the info（information）rich and the info poor. And that divide does exist today.

My wife and I lectured about this looming danger twenty years ago. What was less visible

then, however, were the new, positive forces that work against the digital divide. There are

reasons to be optimistic.

There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow. As the Internet

becomes more and more commercialized, it is in the interest of business to universalize

access-after all, the more people online, the more potential customers there are. More and

more governments, afraid their countries will be left behind, want to spread Internet access.

Within the next decade or two, one to two billion people on the planet will be netted together.

As a result, I now believe the digital divide will narrow rather than widen in the years ahead.

journals in the twentieth century. As a logical

consequence of this development, separate

journals have now appeared aimed mainly

towards either professional or amateur

readership. A rather similar process of

differentiation has led to professional

geologists coming together nationally within

one or two specific societies, whereas the

amateurs have tended either to remain in local

societies or to come together nationally in a

different way.

Although the process of professionalisation

and specialisation was already well under

way in British geology during the nineteenth

century, its full consequences were thus

delayed until the twentieth century. In science

generally, however, the nineteenth century

must be reckoned as the crucial period for this

change in the structure of science.

622

And that is very good news because the Internet may well be the most powerful tool for

combating world poverty that we've ever had.

Of course, the use of the Internet isn't the only way to defeat poverty. And the Internet is

not the only tool we have. But it has enormous potential.

To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to get over their

outdated anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign investment. Countries that still think

foreign investment is an invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history of

infrastructure （the basic structural foundations of a society）in the United States. When the

United States built its industrial infrastructure, it didn't have the capital to do so. And that is

why America's Second Wave infrastructure-including roads, harbors, highways, ports and so

on-were built with foreign investment. The English, the Germans, the Dutch and the French

were investing in Britain's former colony. They financed them. Immigrant Americans built

them. Guess who owns them now? The Americans believe the same thing would be true in

places like Brazil or anywhere else for that matter. The more foreign capital you have helping

you build your Third Wave infrastructure, which today is an electronic infrastructure, the

better off you're going to be. That doesn't mean lying down and becoming fooled, or letting

foreign corporations run uncontrolled. But it does mean recognizing how important they can

be in building the energy and telecom infrastructures needed to take full advantage of the

Internet.

[A] getting worse because of the Internet

Passage 3

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? The American

Society of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this painful question. The organization is

deepsintosa long self-analysis known as the journalism credibility project.

Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors

and spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement about

what in the world those readers really want.

But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through a

set of standard templates (patterns)sintoswhich they plug each day's events. In other words,

there is a conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a

ready-made narrative structure for otherwise confusing news.

There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which

helps explain why the "standard templates" of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a

recent survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around the

country, plus one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned

at random and asked the same questions.

Britain's former colony. They financed them.

Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who

owns them now? The Americans believe the

same thing would be true in places like Brazil

or anywhere else for that matter. The more

foreign capital you have helping you build

your Third Wave infrastructure, which today

is an electronic infrastructure, the better off

you're going to be. That doesn't mean lying

down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign

corporations run uncontrolled. But it does

mean recognizing how important they can be

infrastructures needed to take full advantage

626

Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in

upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, and trade stocks, and they're less likely

to go to church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community.

Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work tends

to reflect the conventional values of this elite. The astonishing distrust of the news media isn't

rooted in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between

reporters and their readers.

This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a

troubled business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers.

Then it sponsors lots of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why

customers are annoyed and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to

noticing the cultural and class biases that so many former buyers are complaining about. If it

did, it would open up its diversity program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and

look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values, education, and class.

59. What is the passage mainly about?

[A] needs of the readers all over the world

[B] causes of the public disappointment about newspapers

[C] origins of the declining newspaper industry

[D] aims of a journalism credibility project

60. The results of the journalism credibility project turned out to be .

The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed.

Won't the wave of business concentration turn into an uncontrollable anti-competitive force?

There's no question that the big are getting bigger and more powerful. Multinational

corporations accounted for less than 20% of international trade in 1982. Today the figure is

more than 25% and growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing

segment of production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment. In

Argentina, for instance, after the reforms of the early 1990s, multinationals went from 43% to

almost 70% of the industrial production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon has

created serious concerns over the role of smaller economic firms, of national businessmen and

I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that

underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower

trade and investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable

of meeting customers' demands. All these are beneficial, not detrimental, to consumers. As

productivity grows, the world's wealth increases.

Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty. Yet it is hard

to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to

competition that were feared nearly a century ago in the US, when the Standard Oil trust was

broken up. The mergers of telecom companies, such as World Com, hardly seem to bring

higher prices for consumers or a reduction in the pace of technical progress. On the contrary,

the price of communications is coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is

increasing—witness Daimler and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan—but it does not appear that

consumers are being hurt.

Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few weeks ago, Alan

Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking industry. Who is going to

supervise, regulate and operate as lender of last resort with the gigantic banks that are being

created? Won't multinationals shift production from one place to another when a nation gets

too strict about infringements to fair competition? And should one country take upon itself the

role of defending competition on issues that affect many other nations, as in the US vs.

Microsoft case?

[A] To take in more foreign funds.

[B] To invest more abroad.

[C] To combine and become bigger.

[A] the greater customer demands

[B] a surplus supply for the market

[C] a growing productivity

[D] the increase of the world's wealth

[B] WorldCom serves as a good example of both benefits and costs

[C] the costs of the globalization process are enormous

Passage 5

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might

become a part of a new international trend. A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my

professional progress prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although, in

the manner of a disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming "I wanted to

spend more time with my family".

Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and two novels later, my experiment in what the

Americans term "downshifting" has turned my tired excuse into an absolute reality. I have

been transformed from a passionate advocate of the philosophy of "having it all", preached by

Linda Kelsey for the past seven years in the page of She magazine, into a woman who is

happy to settle for a bit of everything.

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the

editorship of She after a build up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of "juggling your

life", and making the alternative move into "downshifting" brings with it far greater rewards

than financial success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to return to the kind of

life Kelsey used to advocate and I once enjoyed: 12 hour working days, pressured deadlines,

the fearful strain of office politics and the limitations of being a parent on "quality time".

In America, the move away from juggling to a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle is a wellestablished

trend. Downshifting-also known in America as "voluntary simplicity"-has,

ironically, even bred a new area of what might be termed anti-consumerism. There are a

number of best-selling downshifting self-help books for people who want to simplify their

lives; there are newsletters, such as The Tightwad Gazette, that give hundreds of thousands of

Americans useful tips on anything from recycling their cling-film to making their own soap;

When I decided to quit my full time

employment it never occurred to me that I

might become a part of a new international

trend. A lateral move that hurt my pride and

blocked my professional progress prompted

me to abandon my relatively high profile

career although, in the manner of a disgraced

government minister, I covered my exit by

claiming "I wanted to spend more time with

my family".

Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and

two novels later, my experiment in what the

Americans term "downshifting" has turned

my tired excuse into an absolute reality. I

have been transformed from a passionate

advocate of the philosophy of "having it all",

preached by Linda Kelsey for the past seven

years in the page of She magazine, into a

woman who is happy to settle for a bit of

everything.

当决定辞去自己的全职工作时，我决

没有想到自己会成为国际新潮流的一分

并且阻碍了我的事业发展，这促使我放弃

原来那个地位较高的职业，当然，就像面

子扫尽的政府部长那样，我也掩饰说“我只

想与家人更多的呆在一起”。

奇怪的是，在大约两年半的时间内写

一个对一切浅尝辄止就心满意足的女人。

我发现，放弃“忙忙碌碌”的生活哲学，

而选择一种“放慢生活节奏”的生活所带来

由于压力过大，凯茜已多次公开宣称要辞

I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will

after her much-publicized resignation from

the editorship of She after a build up of stress,

that abandoning the doctrine of "juggling

your life", and making the alternative move

into "downshifting" brings with it far greater

rewards than financial success and social

status. Nothing could persuade me to return to

the kind of life Kelsey used to advocate and I

once enjoyed: 12 hour working days,

pressured deadlines, the fearful strain of

office politics and the limitations of being a

parent on "quality time".

In America, the move away from juggling

to a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle is a

well-established trend. Downshifting-also

known in America as "voluntary simplicity"-

has, ironically, even bred a new area of what

might be termed anti-consumerism. There are

a number of best-selling downshifting selfhelp

books for people who want to simplify

their lives; there are newsletters, such as The

Tightwad Gazette, that give hundreds of

thousands of Americans useful tips on

anything from recycling their cling-film to

making their own soap; there are even support

groups for those who want to achieve the

mid-'90s equivalent of dropping out.

While in America the trend started as a

reaction to the economy decline-after the

mass redundancies caused by downsizing in

the late'80s-and is still linked to the politics of

thrift, in Britain, at least among the middleclass

down-shifters of my acquaintance, we

have different reasons for seeking to simplify

说服我回到过去那种凯茜所宣扬的、我也

曾自得其乐的生活：每天工作12 小时，压

得人喘不过气来的最后期限，办公室里的

尔虞我诈、提心吊胆、紧张不安，为人母

也受到了很大的限制而必须高效，无法与

孩子共渡“优质时间”。

在美国，摆脱忙碌、转向一种简单、

远离物质化的生活已成一种明显的趋势。

具有讽刺意味的是，“放慢生活节奏”——

在美国也称“自愿简单化”——居然还孕育

了一个崭新的、可称之为反消费主义的生

活方式。对于那些想简单生活的人来说，

有许多畅销的自助书籍能帮你轻松生活；

有各种简讯，例如省钱简报，会给美国人

提供成千上万条有用的点子去做事，从回

收保鲜膜到自制肥皂；甚至还有一些帮助

团体专门帮助人们按照90 年代中期脱离

传统社会的那种人的生活方式去生活。

在美国，这种趋势一开始是对经济衰

落所做出的一种反应——出现于80 年代

后期缩小经济规模所引起的大量裁员之后

——现在仍与节俭的观点密切相连；而在

英国，至少在我所认识的那些简化生活的

中产阶级中，寻求简朴生活却有着不同的

原因。

对我们这一代女性来说，整个80 年代

中我们曾被迫忙碌地应付生活，90 年代中

期的简化生活与其说是寻求神话般的美好

生活——自己种有机蔬菜以及冒险制造有

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to

identify shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and

should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and

are in sympathy with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the

problems will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the

disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you

may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.

Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ convention, of a story which works well

because the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is

our lives.

For the women of my generation who were

urged to keep juggling through

the'80s,downshifting in the mid-'90s is not so

being shown around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens,

sunny weather, and so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a

line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes

to the head of the line, grabs his food and stomps over to a table by himself. “Who is that?"

the new arrival asked St. Peter. “On, that’s God," came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks

he’s a doctor."

If you are part of the group which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the

experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to

make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste

in ties. With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an

outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on

safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system.

If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural.

Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed

and unforced manner. Often it’s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak

slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you

are making a light-hearted remark.

Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote “If at

first you don’t succeed, give up" or a play on words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration

and understatements. Look at your talk and pickout a few words or sentences which you can

turn about and inject with humor.

41. To make your humor work, you should .

[A] take advantage of different kinds of audience.

[B] make fun of the disorganized people.

[C] address different problems to different people.

[D] show sympathy for your listeners.

42. The joke about doctors implies that, in the eyes of nurses, they are .

[A] impolite to new arrivals.

[B] very conscious of their godlike role.

[C] entitled to some privileges.

[D] very busy even during lunch hours.

[A] have benefited many people.

[B] are the focus of public attention.

[C] are an inappropriate subject for humor.

[D] have often been the laughing stock.

44. To achieve the desired result, humorous stories should be delivered.

[A] in well-worded language.

[B] as awkwardly as possible.

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope

with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has

resulted in robotics—the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And

if scientists have yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to

come close.

As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose

presence we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our

factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller

terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are

controlled by tireless robo-drivers. And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics

and micro-mechanics, there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain

and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy—far greater precision than highly skilled

physicians can achieve with their hands alone.

But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate

with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for

themselves—goals that pose a real challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a

specific error," says Dave Lavery, manager of a robotics program at NASA, “we can’t yet

give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to reliably interact with a dynamic world."

Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite a

spell of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and

microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010,

researchers lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.

What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one

hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented—and human perception far more

complicated—than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error

of a machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the

human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent

that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road

or the single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer systems on Earth

can’t approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it.

46. Human ingenuity was initially demonstrated in .

[A] the use of machines to produce science fiction.

[B] the wide use of machines in manufacturing industry.

Text 3

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since OPEC agreed to

supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less

than $10 last December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973

oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also almost tripled. Both previous

shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the

headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?

The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports.

Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere,

could push the price higher still in the short term.

Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than

in the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the

price of petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the

retail price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on pump

prices than in the past.

Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to

swings in the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the

importance of heavy, energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software,

consultancy and mobile telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each

dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973.

The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, it oil prices averaged $22 a barrel

for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich

economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the income loss in

1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies—to which heavy

immediately disregard the 98 percent that is

irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the

monkey at the side of a winding forest road or

the single suspicious face in a big crowd. The

most advanced computer systems on Earth

can’t approach that kind of ability, and

neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we

do it.

648

industry has shifted—have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously

squeezed.

One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the

1970s, it has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation and

global excess demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic

decline. The Economist’s commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year ago. In

1973 commodity prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.

51. The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is

[A] global inflation

[B] reduction in supply

[C] fast growth in economy

[D] Iraq’s suspension of exports

52. It can be inferred from the text that the retail price of petrol will go up dramatically if

[A] price of crude rises

[B] commodity prices rise

[C] consumption rises

[D] oil taxes rise

53. The estimates in Economic Outlook show that in rich countries

[A] heavy industry becomes more energy-intensive.

[B] income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices.

[C] manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed.

[D] oil price changes have no significant iMPAct on GDP.

54. We can draw a conclusion from the text that

[A] oil-price shocks are less shocking now.

[B] inflation seems irrelevant to oil-price shocks.

[C] energy conservation can keep down the oil prices.

[D] the price rise of crude leads to the shrinking of heavy industry.

55. From the text we can see that the writer seems

[A] optimistic

[B] sensitive

649

[C] gloomy

[D] scared

Could the bad old days of economic

decline be about to return? Since OPEC

agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of

crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel,

up from less than $10 last December. This

near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary

memories of the 1973 oil shock, when prices

quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also

almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted

in double-digit inflation and global economic

decline. So where are the headlines warning

of gloom and doom this time?

The oil price was given another push up

this week when Iraq suspended oil exports.

Strengthening economic growth, at the same

time as winter grips the northern hemisphere,

could push the price higher still in the short

term.

Yet there are good reasons to expect the

economic consequences now to be less severe

than in the 1970s. In most countries the cost

of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share

of the price of petrol than it did in the 1970s.

In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths

of the retail price, so even quite big changes

in the price of crude have a more muted effect

on pump prices than in the past.

Rich economies are also less dependent on

oil than they were, and so less sensitive to

swings in the oil price. Energy conservation,

a shift to other fuels and a decline in the

importance of heavy, energy-intensive

industries have reduced oil consumption.

Software, consultancy and mobile telephones

use far less oil than steel or car production.

For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices)

rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil

than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its

latest Economic Outlook that, it oil prices

averaged $22 a barrel for a full year,

compared with $13 in 1998, this would

increase the oil import bill in rich economies

by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than

one-quarter of the income loss in 1974 or

1980. On the other hand, oil-importing

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications

for how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.

Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the

Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect," a centuries-old moral

principle holding that an action having two effects—a good one that is intended and a harmful

one that is foreseen—is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.

Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to

control terminally ill patients’ pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the

patient.

Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will

shield doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give

patients sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death."

George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as

long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done

nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. “It’s like surgery," he says.

“We don’t call those deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients,

although they risked their death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as

long as you don’t intend their suicide."

industry has shifted—have become more

energy-intensive, and so could be more

seriously squeezed.

One more reason not to lose sleep over the

rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the

1970s, it has not occurred against the

background of general commodity-price

inflation and global excess demand. A sizable

portion of the world is only just emerging

from economic decline. The Economist’s

commodity price index is broadly unchanging

from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices

jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.

上升了近30％。

652

On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide

debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has

prolonged the physical agony of dying.

Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National

Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving

Care at the End of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of

“ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of

dying" as the twin problems of end-of-life care.

The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospitals, to test

knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for

hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of

life.

Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical

initiatives translate into better care. “Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the

pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering," to the extent that it constitutes

“systematic patient abuse." He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear…that

painful deaths are presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should result in

license suspension."

56. From the first three paragraphs, we learn that .

[A] doctors used to increase drug dosages to control their patients’ pain.

[B] it is still illegal for doctors to help the dying end their lives.

[C] the Supreme Court strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide.

[B] Modern medicine has assisted terminally ill patients in painless recovery.

[C] The Court ruled that high-dosage pain-relieving medication can be prescribed.

[D] insufficient hospital care.

Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster who built

the Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was

fascinated with information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the

"great game" of espionage-----spying as a "profession." These days the Net, which has

already re-made pastimes as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan's vocation

as well.

The last revolution isn't simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen's e-mail.

That kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the past three or four years,

the world wide web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying. The spooks

call it "open source intelligence," and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly influential.

in 1995 the CIA held a contest to see who could compile the most data about Burundi. The

winner, by a large margin, was a tiny Virginia company called Open-Source Solutions，whose

clear advantage was its mastery of the electronic world.

Among the firms making the biggest splash in the new world is Straitford, Inc., a private

Straifford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of mutually

we'll hear back from some of them." Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since

it can be difficult to tell good information from bad. That’s where Straitford earns its keep.

Friedman relies on a lean staff in Austin. Several of his staff members have militaryintelligence

backgrounds. He sees the firm's outsider status as the key to its success.

To paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, “all that is needed for the triumph

of a misguided cause is that good people do nothing.”One such cause now seeks to end

biomedical research because of the theory that animals have rights ruling out their use in

research. Scientists need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments

are confusing the public and thereby threatening advances in health knowledge and care.

Leaders of the animal rights movement target biomedical research because it depends on

public funding, and few people understand the process of health care research. Hearing

allegations of cruelty to animals in research settings, many are perplexed that anyone would

deliberately harm an animal.

For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street

fair was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that opposed

immunizations, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured

that they do, she replied, “Then I would have to say yes.”Asked what will happen when

epidemics return, she said, “Don’t worry, scientists will find some way of using

computers.”Such well-meaning people just don't understand.

Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate,

understandable, way-in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to

make clear the connection between animal research and a grandmother's hip replacement, a

father's bypass operation a baby's vaccinations, and even a pet's shots. To those who are

unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new

treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.

Much can be done. Scientists could “adopt” middle school classes and present their own

research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, lest animal rights

misinformation go unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research

institutions could be opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care.

Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should

actively recruit to its cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who

has made courageous statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive

medical treatment. If good people do nothing there is a real possibility that an uninformed

citizenry will extinguish the precious embers of medical progress.

the theory that animals have rights ruling out

their use in research. Scientists need to

respond forcefully to animal rights advocates,

whose arguments are confusing the public

and thereby threatening advances in health

knowledge and care. Leaders of the animal

rights movement target biomedical research

because it depends on public funding, and

few people understand the process of health

care research. Hearing allegations of cruelty

to animals in research settings, many are

perplexed that anyone would deliberately

harm an animal.

For example, a grandmotherly woman

staffing an animal rights booth at a recent

street fair was distributing a brochure that

encouraged readers not to use anything that

opposed immunizations, she wanted to know

if vaccines come from animal research. When

assured that they do, she replied, “Then I

would have to say yes.”Asked what will

happen when epidemics return, she said,

“Don’t worry, scientists will find some way

of using computers.”Such well-meaning

people just don't understand.

Scientists must communicate their

少有人懂得医学研究的过程。当人们听到

医学实验虐待动物的指控时，许多人都不

In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into

message to the public in a compassionate,

understandable, way-in human terms, not in

the language of molecular biology. We need

to make clear the connection between animal

research and a grandmother's hip replacement,

a father's bypass operation a baby's

vaccinations, and even a pet's shots. To those

who are unaware that animal research was

needed to produce these treatments, as well as

new treatments and vaccines, animal research

seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.

Much can be done. Scientists could

“adopt” middle school classes and present

their own research. They should be quick to

respond to letters to the editor, lest animal

rights misinformation go unchallenged and

acquire a deceptive appearance of truth.

Research institutions could be opened to tours,

to show that laboratory animals receive

humane care. Finally, because the ultimate

stakeholders are patients, the health research

community should actively recruit to its cause

not only well-known personalities such as

Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous

statements about the value of animal research,

but all who receive medical treatment. If

good people do nothing there is a real

possibility that an uninformed citizenry will

extinguish the precious embers of medical

progress.

治疗方法和疫苗都必须进行动物实验。对

于他们来说，动物实验说得好听点是浪费，

说得不好听就是残忍。

有很多事情可以做。科学家可以“采

用”中学课堂来介绍自己的研究，展示实验

结果。他们应该对报刊的读者来信及时做

出反应，以防止动物权利的误导言论不受

质疑、披上真理的骗人外衣。科研机构应

该对外开放允许人们参观，向大家展示实

验室里的动物如何获得悉心的照顾。最后，

因为最终的受益质是病人，医疗研究机构

不仅应该积极争取斯蒂芬·库柏这样的名人

的支持——他对动物实验的价值勇敢地进

行了肯定——而且应该争取所有接受治疗

的病人的支持。如果好人袖手旁观，还真

有可能让不明真相的人们扑灭医学进步中

珍贵的火种。

supersystems, causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four

railroads accounted for under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after

a series of mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the

freight moved by major rail carriers.

Supporters of the new super systems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial

cost reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is

removed by fierce competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk

commodities traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too

costly and the railroads therefore have them by the throat.

The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by

only one rail company. Railroads typically charge such “captive” shippers 20 to 30 percent

more than they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel

they are being overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government's Surface

Transportation Board for rate relief, but the process is expensive, time consuming, and will

work only in truly extreme cases.

Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the

long run it reduces everyone's cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate,

they argue, shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of

transportation would do so, leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up

the line. It's theory to which many economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves

railroads in the position of determining which companies will flourish and which will fail.

“Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who wins and who loses in the

marketplace?” asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents shipper.

Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be his with a round of huge rate

increases. The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortuning fortunes. still

does not earn enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging

traffic. Yet railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street

cheering them on. Consider the .2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire

Conrail this year. Conrail's net railway operating income in 1996 was just million, less than

half of the carrying costs of the transaction. Who's going to pay for the rest of the bill? Many

captive shippers fear that they will, as Norfolk Southern and CSX increase their grip on the

market.

51. According to those who support mergers railway monopoly is unlikely because

[A] cost reduction is based on competition.

[B] services call for cross-trade coordination.

[C] outside competitors will continue to exist.

[D] shippers will have the railway by the throat.

52. What is many captive shippers' attitude towards the consolidation in the rail industry?

[A] Indifferent.

[B] Supportive.

[C] Indignant.

[D] Apprehensive.

53. It can be inferred from paragraph 3 that

[A] shippers will be charged less without a rival railroad

[B] there will soon be only one railroad company nationwide.

[C] overcharged shippers are unlikely to appeal for rate relief.

[D] a government board ensures fair play in railway business.

54. The word “arbiters”(line 7,paragraph 4)most probably refers to those

[A] who work as coordinators.

[B] who function as judges.

[C] who supervise transactions.

[D] who determine the price.

55. According to the text, the cost increase in the rail industry is mainly caused by

[A] the continuing acquisition.

[B] the growing traffic

[C] the cheering Wall Street.

[D] the shrinking market.

It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California

optional. Small wonder. Americans' life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century.

Failing hips can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minuts

surgical procedure. Such advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was

unimaginable when I entered medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system

can cure death-and our failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.

Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under

ideal conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat

which companies will flourish and which will

fail. “Do we really want railroads to be the

death as a problem to be solved. Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we

demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it's useless. The most obvious

example is late-stage cancer care. Physicians-frustrated by their inability to cure the disease

and fearing loss of hope in the patient-too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is

scientifically justified.

In1950, the U.S. spent .7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be billion. Anyone

can see this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars

conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care

that sustains life beyond a certain age-----say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard

Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty todie and get out of the

way”, so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential.

I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and

beyond, and remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone

jokingly claims to be 53.Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is in her 70s, and

former Surgeon General C.Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s.These leaders

are living proof that prevention works and that we can manage the health problems that come

naturally with age. As a mere 68-year-old, I wish to age as productively as they have.

Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. Ask a physician, I know

the most costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that

people in Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved

longer, healthier lives than we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for

unlikely cures while underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people's

lives.

56. What is implied in the first sentence?

[A] Americans are better prepared for death than other people.

[B] Americans enjoy a higher life quality than ever before.

[C] Americans are over-confident of their medical technology.

[D] Americans take a vain pride in their long life expectancy.

57. The author uses the example of cancer patients to show that

[A] medical resources are often wasted.

[B] doctors are helpless against fatal diseases.

[C] some treatments are too aggressive.

671

[D] medical costs are becoming unaffordable.

58. The author's attitude toward Richard Lamm's remark is one of

[A] strong disapproval.

[B] reserved consent.

[C] slight contempt.

D. enthusiastic support.

59. In contrast to the U.S., Japan and Sweden are funding their medical care

[A] more flexibly.

[B] more extravagantly.

[C] more cautiously.

[D] more reasonably.

60. The text intends to express the idea that

[A] medicine will further prolong people's lives.

**2004**年研究生入学考试英语阅读理解**A**

**Text 1**

Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across CareerBuilder, a

job database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site’s

personal search agent. It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as

location, title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the

database. Redmon chose the keywords legal, intellectual property, and Washington, D.C.

Three weeks later, he got his first notification of an opening. “I struck gold,” says Redmon,

who E-mailed his resume to the employer and won a position as in-house counsel for a

company.

With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding promising openings can be

time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the

databases. But although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks.

Narrowing your criteria, for example, may work against you: “Every time you answer a

question you eliminate a possibility.” says one expert.

For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept——what you think you want

to do——then broaden it. “None of these programs do that,” says another expert. “There‘s no

career counseling implicit in all of this.” Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind

675

of tip service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database；when you get E-mail, consider it

a reminder to check the database again. “I would not rely on agents for finding everything that

is added to a database that might interest me,” says the author of a job-searching guide.

Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite’s agent

sends out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only

three potential jobs——those it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in

the database; job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them——and they do. “On

the day after we send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our traffic,” says Seth Peets,

vice president of marketing for CareerSite.

Even those who aren‘t hunting for jobs may find search agents worthwhile. Some use

them to keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on

compensation to arm themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily employed,

Redmon maintains his agent at CareerBuilder. “You always keep your eyes open,” he says.

Working with a personal search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for you.

41. How did Redmon find his job?

[A] By searching openings in a job database.

[B] By posting a matching position in a database.

[C] By using a special service of a database.

[D] By E-mailing his resume to a database.

42. Which of the following can be a disadvantage of search agents?

[A] Lack of counseling.

[B] Limited number of visits.

[C] Lower efficiency.

[D] Fewer successful matches.

43. The expression “tip service”（Line 4, Paragraph 3） most probably means

[A] advisory

[B] compensation

[C] interaction

[D] reminder

44. Why does CareerSite’s agent offer each job hunter only three job options?

[A] To focus on better job matches.

676

[B] To attract more returning visits.

[C] To reserve space for more messages.

[D] To increase the rate of success.

45. Which of the following is true according to the text?

[A] Personal search agents are indispensable to job-hunters.

[B] Some sites keep E-mailing job seekers to trace their demands.

[C] Personal search agents are also helpful to those already employed.

[D] Some agents stop sending information to people once they are employed

drawbacks. Narrowing your criteria, for

example, may work against you: “Every time

you answer a question you eliminate a

possibility.” says one expert.

For any job search, you should start with

a narrow concept——what you think you

want to do——then broaden it. “None of

these programs do that,” says another expert.

“There‘s no career counseling implicit in all

of this.” Instead, the best strategy is to use the

agent as a kind of tip service to keep abreast

of jobs in a particular database；when you get

E-mail, consider it a reminder to check the

database again. “I would not rely on agents

for finding everything that is added to a

database that might interest me,” says the

author of a job-searching guide.

Some sites design their agents to tempt

job hunters to return. When CareerSite’s

agent sends out messages to those who have

signed up for its service, for example, it

简历发给了那位老板，由此得到了该公司

内部法律顾问的职位。

互联网上有成千上万个与找工作有关

的网站，要找到一个好的机会需要花很多

时间，而且往往效率不高。搜索代理使人

们不必一直去查阅数据库。但是，虽然有

一个搜索代理帮了Redmon 的忙，就业专

家们还是看到了一些缺点。例如，将自己

的工作标准范围设定得过窄反而对你不

利，“每回答一个问题，你就失去了一个

找到另外一种工作的机会，”一个专家说。

无论找什么样的工作，你都应该从一

个小范围的概念开始——你认为你想干的

工作——然后拓宽这个范围。“这些电脑

程序中没有一个是这么设计的，”另一个

专家说。“整个系统中没有任何关于就业

咨询的内容。”因此，最好的办法就是将

软件代理当成一种提示服务，通过它来掌

握某个数据库中的求职信息；收到电子邮

件的时候，就当它是提醒你再去那个数据

库里看一看。“我不会指望只靠搜索代理

功能帮我找到数据库中所有吸引我的信

有的网站尽力设计自己的代理系统，

以吸引求职者的回访。例如，“事业网站”

Over the past century， all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned

or made illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet

unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin

with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.

It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over

Zodiac cars when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the

advantage that Adam Abbott has in life over Zoeuml; Zysman. English names are fairly

evenly spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top

people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K.

Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C

respectively; and 26 of George Bush‘s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the

first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking， six of the

considers the best matches. There may be

more matches in the database; job hunters

will have to visit the site again to find

them——and they do. “On the day after we

send our messages, we see a sharp increase in

our traffic,” says Seth Peets, vice president of

marketing for CareerSite.

Even those who aren‘t hunting for jobs

may find search agents worthwhile. Some use

them to keep a close watch on the demand for

their line of work or gather information on

compensation to arm themselves when

negotiating for a raise. Although happily

employed, Redmon maintains his agent at

CareerBuilder. “You always keep your eyes

open,” he says. Working with a personal

search agent means having another set of eyes

looking out for you.

47-year-old manicurist isn’t cutting, filing or polishing as many nails as she’d like to. Most of

her clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped

showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. “I’m a good economic indicator,” she says.

“I provide a service that people can do without when they’re concerned about saving some

dollars.” So Spero is downscaling, shopping at a middle-brow Dillard’s department store near

her suburban Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. “I don’t know if other clients are

going to abandon me, too.” she says.

Gap outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For

retailers, who last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and

Christmas, the cautious approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday

sales are off 7 percent from last year’s pace. But don’t sound any alarms just yet. Consumers

seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the

economy’s long-term prospects, even as they do some modest belt-tightening.

Consumers say they’re not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own

“there’s a new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed

by Wall Street bonuses,” says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still

Americans today don‘t place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes,

entertainers, and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our

children to get a practical education——not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge.

Symptoms of pervasive anti-intellectualism in our schools aren’t difficult to find.

“Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than

intellectual,” says education writer Diane Ravitch. “Schools could be a counterbalance.”

Razitch‘s latest bock, _Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms_, traces the roots of antiintellectualism

in our schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the

American distaste for intellectual pursuits.

But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind leaves them

vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their

ideas and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy.

Continuing along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, “We will become a second-rate country.

We will have a less civil society.”

“Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor

Richard Hofstadter in Anti-Intellectualism in American life, a Pulitzer Prize winning book on

the roots of anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of

our history, says Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject

anything that smells of elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence have been

considered more noble qualities than anything you could learn from a book.

Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and

rigorous book learning put unnatural restraints on children: “We are shut up in schools and

college recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and

do not know a thing.” Mark Twain‘s Huckleberry Finn exemplified American antiintellectualism.

Its hero avoids being civilized——going to school and learning to read——so

he can preserve his innate goodness.

Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we

reluctantly admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind.

Intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders,

wonders, theorizes, criticizes and imagines.

School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country‘s

educational system is in the grips of people who “joyfully and militantly proclaim their

hostility to intellect and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least

intellectual promise.”

688

56. What do American parents expect their children to acquire in school?

[A] The habit of thinking independently.

[B] Profound knowledge of the world.

[C] Practical abilities for future career.

[D] The confidence in intellectual pursuits.

57. We can learn from the text that Americans have a history of

[A] undervaluing intellect.

[B] favoring intellectualism.

[C] supporting school reform.

[D] suppressing native intelligence.

58. The views of Ravish and Emerson on schooling are

[A] identical.

[B] similar.

[C] complementary.

[D] opposite.

59. Emerson, according to the text, is probably

[A] a pioneer of education reform.

[B] an opponent of intellectualism.

[C] a scholar in favor of intellect.

[D] an advocate of regular schooling.

60. What does the author think of intellect?

[A] It is second to intelligence.

[B] It evolves from common sense.

[C] It is to be pursued.

[D] It underlies power.

教授在他的《美国社会中的反知识主义》

一书中写道。这本书获得了普利策奖，是

关于美国政治、宗教和教育中的反知识主

书本中学来的任何东西都高尚的资质。

认为学校教育和高强度的书本学习会使孩

schooling and rigorous book learning put

unnatural restraints on children: “We are shut

up in schools and college recitation rooms for

10 or 15 years and come out at last with a

bellyful of words and do not know a thing.”

Mark Twain‘s Huckleberry Finn exemplified

American anti-intellectualism. Its hero avoids

being civilized——going to school and

learning to read——so he can preserve his

innate goodness.

Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is

different from native intelligence, a quality

we reluctantly admire. Intellect is the critical,

creative, and contemplative side of the mind.

Intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, reorder,

and adjust, while intellect examines,

ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes and

imagines.

School remains a place where intellect is

mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country‘s

educational system is in the grips of people

who “joyfully and militantly proclaim their

hostility to intellect and their eagerness to

identify with children who show the least

intellectual promise.”

提问、总结理论、批判和想象。

目前学校里知识仍遭到怀疑。

Hofstadter 说我们国家的教育体系掌握在

这样一些人手中，他们“毫不掩饰自己对知

Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a

colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might

even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human”, with the underlying

assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of

grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta,

Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.

The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys, which have all

the necessary ingredients to capture the public imagination. They look cute. They are goodnatured,

co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their finicky

female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and

services” than males (although why this is so remains a mystery).

Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr Brosnan's and Dr de Waal's study.

The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food.

Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to swap pieces of rock for slices of cucumber.

However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each

could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became

markedly different.

In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So

when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to

hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to

provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or

out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a

grape in the other chamber (in the absence of an actual monkey able to eat it) was enough to

induce sullen behaviour in a female capuchin.

Dr Brosnan and Dr de Waal report that such behaviour is unusual in their trained monkeys.

During two years of bartering prior to these experiments, failure to exchange tokens for food

occurred in fewer than 5% of trials. And what made the behaviour even more extraordinary

693

was that these monkeys forfeited food that they could see—and which they would have

readily accepted in almost any other set of circumstances.

The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social

emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is

likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous

indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward

completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However,

whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether

it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35m years ago, is, as yet, an

unanswered question.

21. In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by

[A] posing a contrast.

[B] justifying an assumption.

[C] making a comparison.

[D] explaining a phenomenon.

22. The statement “it is all too monkey” (Last line, Paragraph 1) implies that

[A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals.

[B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys’ nature.

[C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other.

[D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions.

23. Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they are

[A] more inclined to weigh what they get.

[B] attentive to researchers’ instructions.

[C] nice in both appearance and temperament.

[D] more generous than their male companions.

24. Dr. Brosnan and Dr. de Waal have eventually found in their study that the monkeys

[A] prefer grapes to cucumbers.

[B] can be taught to exchange things.

[C] will not be co-operative if feeling cheated.

[D] are unhappy when separated from others.

694

25. What can we infer from the last paragraph?

[A] Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.

[B] Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.

[C] Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.

[D] Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the

doubters insisted that we didn't know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the

science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the

government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over

three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.

There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us

to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy

of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth's atmosphere is definitely

warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get

moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Albert, added this

key point in the preface to the panel's report "Science never has all the answers. But science

does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and

the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning

the future consequences of present actions."

Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about

global warming is incomplete, that it's OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know

for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be

too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance

policy now.

Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it's obvious that a majority of

the president's advisers still don't take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action,

they continue to press for more research -- a classic case of "paralysis by analysis."

To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper

atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration

won't take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation

measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer

financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is

[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death.

[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant.

Of all the components of a good night's sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control.

In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A

century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised

shadows of our unconscious desires and rears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to

thinking of them as just “mental noise” the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that

goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind's emotional

thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is “off-line”. And one leading authority says that

these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under

conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better, “It's your dream” says Rosalind Cartwright,

chair of psychology at Chicago's Medical Center. “If you don't like it, change it.”

Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid

eye movement) sleep-when most vivid dreams occur-as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric

Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved,

action, they continue to press for more

research -- a classic case of "paralysis by

analysis."

To serve as responsible stewards of the

planet, we must press forward on deeper

atmospheric and oceanic research. But

research alone is inadequate. If the

Administration won't take the legislative

initiative, Congress should help to begin

fashioning conservation measures. A bill by

Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West

Virginia, which would offer financial

meet our energy needs. If we are ever going

to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that

those new plants be environmentally sound.

the limbic system (the “emotional brain”)is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the

center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy of

depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr,

William Dement.

The link between dreams and emotions show up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic.

Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier

ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated

during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think

about the emotional significance of the day’s events—until, it appears, we begins to dream.

And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise

conscious control over recurring bad dreams As soon as you awaken, identify what is

upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead, the next time is

occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn

to, literally, do it in their sleep.

At the end of the day, there's probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all

unless they keep us from sleeping of “we wake u in a panic, ”Cartwright says Terrorism,

economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people's anxiety.

Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist For the rest of

us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep-or rather dream-on it and

you'll feel better in the morning.

[A] can be modified in their courses.

[B] are susceptible to emotional changes.

And this process need not be left to the

American no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the

English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his

latest book, Doing Our Own Thing. The Degradation of language and Music and why we

should like, care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and

conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline

of formal English.

Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against

the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic specialty is language history and change,

and he sees the gradual disappearance of “whom”, for example, to be natural and no more

regrettable than the loss of the case-ending of Old English.

But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing”, has spelt the death of

formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an

elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded

writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the

highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both

oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.

Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend

that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his

subtitle, why we should, like care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human

language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive-there

exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas He is not arguing,

as many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.

Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized

poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem oldfashioned

In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for

homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the

casualness and absence of consumption” launched by the 19th--century department stores that

offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a

knowledgeable elite.” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or

background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media,

advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether

elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory

Rodriguez reports that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented level nor resistant to

assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent .In the

10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10years prior

to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation –language, home

ownership and intermarriage.

The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most

common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.”

The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third

generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the

description of America as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign–born immigrants

who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8

percent rate among native-born Americans.

Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S –born

whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-

Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian–American women are married to non-Asians.

Rodriguez note that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrant living

within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”

Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big

enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent

past, today’s social induces suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.

[A] identifying

Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry-William Shakespeare-but there

are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare

Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare

Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists

who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s

birthplace and the other sights.

The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They

frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and

noisiness. It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their

living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise - making.

The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus- and often

take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side – don’t usually see the plays, and

some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do

manage a little sight - seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends,

who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or

five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything

and get out of town by nightfall.

The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the

subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless

every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its

own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the

Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.

Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a

subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its

1,431 seats were 94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason,

of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.

enough to have a bit of everything. But

particularly when viewed against America’s

turbulent past, today’s social induces suggest

a dark and deteriorating social environment

716

It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people

who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights.

They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) –lean, pointed, dedicated faces,

wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones

outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and

sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.

26. From the first two paragraphs, we learn that

[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC’s contribution to the town’s revenue

[B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage

[C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms

[D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism

27. It can be inferred from Para 3 that

[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately

[B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers

[C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers

[D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater

28. By saying “Stratford cries poor traditionally” (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the author implies

that

[A. Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects

[B. Stratford has long been in financial difficulties

[C. the town is not really short of money

[D. the townsfolk used to be poorly paid

29. According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because

[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending

[B] the company is financially ill-managed

[C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable

[D] the theatre attendance is on the rise

30. From the text we can conclude that the author

[A] is supportive of both sides

[B] favors the townsfolk’s view

When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the

large animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived, the large, slow-

Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally.

Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be

adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton

is building its own hotel there, which you

may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet

Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the

Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and

will be very expensive.

Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand

why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs

a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance

records for three years in a row. Last year its

1,431 seats were 94 per cent occupied all

year long and this year they’ll do better.) The

reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed

and ticket prices have stayed low.

It would be a shame to raise prices too

much because it would drive away the young

people who are Stratford’s most attractive

clientele. They come entirely for the plays,

not the sights. They all seem to look alike

(though they come from all over) –lean,

pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and

sandals, eating their buns and bedding down

for the night on the flagstones outside the

theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standingroom

tickets held for the sleepers and sold to

them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.

特汉堡酒吧、李尔休息室、班科宴会厅等

等。这些地方都将极尽奢华。

总之，居民就是不能理解为什么RSC

需要补贴（剧院已经连续三年打破了上座

率纪录。去年一整年剧院1431 个座位的上

坐率达到了94%，今年还会更高）。当然，

剧院的理由是，演戏成本提高了，然而票

价仍然很低。

票价的大幅度涨价是一件很为难的事

情，因为这样会把年轻人们赶走，而他们

是斯特拉特福德的最有魅力的顾客。他们

完全是为了莎剧而来，并不是为了观光。

他们看起来全都一个样（虽然他们来自四

面八方）——消瘦、率直、神情专注，穿

着牛仔裤和拖鞋，吃着小圆面包，在剧场

外的石板上过夜，为的是等着售票处上午

10 点半开门出售专门为这些睡石板路的年

轻人们预留的20 张坐票和80 张站票。

growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something

similar could be happening in the oceans.

That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years what researchers such as

Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have

looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods de not attempt

to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in

particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their

latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other

animals) inanes fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of

exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then.

Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative, one reason for this is that

fishing technology has improved. Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and

sonar, which were not available 50 years ago that means a higher proportion of what is in the

sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than

the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been

more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since to

baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish

stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to

sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer

sharks around noise.

Dr. Myers and Dr. worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future

management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current

among marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline”. The notion is that people have failed

to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been

looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests

that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped form a fishery comes when the

biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below

that, which is a bad way to de business.

31. The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that

[A] large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment

[B] small species survived as large animals disappeared

[C] large sea animals may face the same threat today.

[D] Slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones

32. Who can infer form Dr Myers and Dr. Worm’s paper that

[A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%

[B] there are only half as many fisheries are there were 15 years ago

[C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount

[D] the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisherish than in the old

33. By saying these figures are conservative (line in ,paragragf-3), Dr worm means that

[A] fishing technology has improved rapidly

[B] then catch-sizes are actually smaller then recorded

[C] the marine bio mass has suffered a greater loss

[D] the date collected so far are pit pf date.

34. Dr Myers and other researchers hold that

[A] people should look for a baseline that can’t work for a longer time

[B] fisheries should keep the yield below 50% of the biomass

[C] the ocean biomass should restored its original level.

[D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situation.

Many things make people think artists are weird and the weirdest may be this: artists only

job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.

This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best

suited for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing

happiness as insipid, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils

to Baudelaire’s flowers of evil.

You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have

seen such misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the

massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn

happiness in the world today.

After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to

depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the

emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an

ideal but an ideology.

People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until

exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass

communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which

reminded worshippers that their souls were in peril and that they would someday be meat for

worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.

Today the messages your average Westerner is bombarded with are not religious but

commercial, and forever happy .Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling,

smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And

since these messages have an agenda--to lure us to open our wallets to make the very idea of

happiness seem unreliable. "Celebrate!" commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex,

before we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.

What we forget--what our economy depends on is forgetting--is that happiness is more than

pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for

loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone

to tell us as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything

ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It’s a message even

more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

725

36. By citing the example of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends to show

that

[A] Poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music.

[B] Art grow out of both positive and negative feeling.

[C] Poets today are less skeptical of happiness.

[D] Artist have changed their focus of interest.

37. The word “bummer” (Line 5. paragraph 5) most probably means something

[A] religious

[B] unpleasant

[C] entertaining

[D] commercial

38. In the author’s opinion, advertising

[A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy part.

[B] is a cause of disappointment for the general peer

[C] replace the church as a major source of information

[D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself.

39.We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes

[A] Happiness more often than not ends in sadness.

[B] The anti-happy art is distasteful by refreshing.

[C] Misery should be enjoyed rather than denied.

[D] The anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms

40. Which of the following is true of the text?

[A] Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.

[B] Art provides a balance between expectation and reality.

[C] People feel disappointed at the realities of morality.

[D] mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup

astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher

oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to

conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.

Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he

believes strongly in "none of the above." Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear

engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if

he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory:

training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. "With the first subject,

after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20," Ericsson recalls. "He

kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers."

This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically

determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive

exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may

exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person

"encodes" the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information

meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate

practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals,

obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range

of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics

and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high

achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is

highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers -- whether in memory or surgery,

ballet or computer programming -- are nearly always made, not born.

21. The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to

[AI stress the importance of professional training.

[B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.

[C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.

[D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others.

22. The word "mania" (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means

[A] fun.

[B] craze.

[C] hysteria.

730

[D] excitement.

23. According to Ericsson, good memory

[A] depends on meaningful processing of information.

[B] results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises.

[C] is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors.

[D] requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration.

24. Ericsson and his colleagues believe that

[A] talent is a dominating factor for professional success.

[B] biographical data provide the key to excellent performance.

[C] the role of talent tends to be overlooked.

[D] high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture.

25. Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to convey?

[A] “Faith will move mountains.”

[B] “One reaps what one sows.”

differences are swamped by how well each

person "encodes" the information. And the

best way to learn how to encode information

meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a

process known as deliberate practice.

Deliberate practice entails more than simply

repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting

specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback

and concentrating as much on technique as on

outcome.

Ericsson and his colleagues have thus

taken to studying expert performers in a wide

range of pursuits, including soccer. They

gather all the data they can, not just

performance statistics and biographical

details but also the results of their own

laboratory experiments with high achievers.

Their work makes a rather startling assertion:

the trait we commonly call talent is highly

overrated. Or, put another way, expert

performers -- whether in memory or surgery,

ballet or computer programming -- are nearly

always made, not born.

For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column

called “Ask Marilyn." People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had

tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 -- the

highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to

envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among

other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the

average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What's the difference between love and fondness? Or what

is the nature of luck and coincidence? It's not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects

and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of

the best poets and philosophers.

Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be

smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from

neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?

The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ

tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the

Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler intelligence Scales (both come in adult

and children's version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only

by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web.

Superhigh scores like vos Savant's are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a

statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age

by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the

Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main

aspects of IQ tests.

Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in

school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence

Testing?", Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail

to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving

and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or

situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were

given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively

correlated with leadership -- that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through

734

SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or

what questions to skip.

26. Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?

[A] Answering philosophical questions.

[B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.

[C] Telling the differences between certain concepts.

[D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.

27. What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?

[A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.

[B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.

[C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.

[D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.

28. People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant's because

[A] the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.

[B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.

[C] vos Savant's case is an extreme one that will not repeat.

[D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.

29. We can conclude from the last paragraph that

[A] test scores may not be reliable indicators of one’s ability.

[B] IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated.

[C] testing involves a lot of guesswork.

[D] traditional tests are out of date.

30. What is the author's attitude towards IQ tests?

[A] Supportive.

[B] Skeptical.

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on

hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been transformed by economic

risk and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a

family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.

In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family

economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social

implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as

well. Today's families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a

result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial setback -- a back-up

earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or

fell sick. This "added-worker effect" could support the safety net offered by unemployment

the important elements necessary to succeed

in school and in life, argues Robert J.

Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is

Intelligence Testing?", Sternberg notes that

traditional tests best assess analytical and

verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and

practical knowledge, components also critical

insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to

family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home

partner.

During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their

retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are

joining millions of families who must worry about interest-rates, stock market fluctuation,

and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year,

President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with retirees

trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment

returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of

healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen -- and newly fashionable healthsavings

plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher

deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families' future healthcare. Even

demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak

elderly parent -- and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance -- have

jumped eightfold in just one generation.

From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like

an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a

frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already

overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be

far behind.

[A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.

[B] their chances of being laid off have greatly increased.

[C] they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics.

[D] they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance.

32. As a result of President Bush's reform, retired people may have

[A] a higher sense of security.

[B] less secured payments.

[C] less chance to invest.

[D] a guaranteed future.

[A] help reduce the cost of healthcare.

[B] popularize among the middle class.

[A] financial risks tend to outweigh political risks.

[B] the middle class may face greater political challenges.

[C] financial problems may bring about political problems.

[D] financial responsibility is an indicator of political status.

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst

accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a

new problem threatens to earn them -- especially in America -- the sort of nasty headlines that

inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd,

low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as

banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss's agenda in

businesses of every variety.

Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year – from organizations as

diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International

Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley -- have left managers hurriedly peering

into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.

"Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset," says

Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. "The ability to guard customer

data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders".

Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),

perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of

New York’s Columbia Business School. "Setting the proper investment level for security,

redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one," he says.

The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious

to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed

and hugely expensive to restore -- and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a

company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.

The current state of affairs may have been encouraged -- though not justified -- by the lack

of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently

passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went

responsibility, and a good deal more like a

frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift

of financial risk onto their already

astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the

rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million

credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important

decision a day earlier by America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate

America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.

36. The statement “It never rains but it pours” is used to introduce

[A] the fierce business competition.

[B] the feeble boss-board relations.

[C] the threat from news reports.

[D] the severity of data leakage.

37. According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out

[A] whether there is any weak point.

[B] what sort of data has been stolen.

[C] who is responsible for the leakage.

[D] how the potential spies can be located.

38. In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that

[A] shareholders’ interests should be properly attended to.

[B] information protection should be given due attention.

[C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.

[D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.

39. According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to

[A] see the link between trust and data protection.

[B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data.

[C] realize the high cost of data restoration.

[D] appreciate the economic value of trust.

40. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that

[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe.

[B] FTC’s decision is essential to data security.

encouraged -- though not justified -- by the

While still catching-up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way

ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing

depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr.

Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.

Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affects the

stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do

748

males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had

their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became

equal to those of the males.

Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased

“opportunities” for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that

they have so much more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress

may even be greater than men’s,” she observes, “It’s just that they’re dealing with so many

more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”

Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things

that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war

and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence.

The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic

situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family numbers, and they tend not to be oneshot

deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite

devastating.”

Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but wad determined to finish

college. “I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that

that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later her marriage ended

and she became a single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job,

pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”

Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But

most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain.

Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it

threatens your health and your ability to function.

21. Which of the following is true according to the first two paragraphs?

[A] Women are biologically more vulnerable to stress.

[B] Women are still suffering much stress caused by men.

[C] Women are more experienced than men in coping with stress.

[D] Men and women show different inclinations when faced with stress.

22. Dr. Yehuda’s research suggests that women

[A] Need extra doses of chemicals to handle stress.

[B] Have limited capacity for tolerating stress.

[C] Are more capable of avoiding stress.

749

[D] Are exposed to more stress.

23. According to Paragraph 4, the stress women confront tends to be

[A] domestic and temporary.

[B] irregular and violent.

[C] durable and frequent.

[D] trivial and random.

24. The sentence “I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”(Line 6, Para. 5) shows that

[A] Alvarez cared about nothing but making money.

[B] Alvarez’s salary barely covered her household expenses.

[C] Alvarez got paychecks from different jobs.

[D] Alvarez paid practically everything by check.

25. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

[A] Strain of Stress: No Way Out?

[B] Responses to Stress: Gender Difference

[C] Stress Analysis: What Chemicals Say

[D] Gender Inequality: Women Under Stress

现代生活中，女性在很多领域仍然在追赶

男性，但是在有一个方面她们却远远超过

了男性，尽管这并不是她们所乐意看到的。

“比起男人，妇女在压力下更加容易受到由

说道。

“她们承受压力的能力也许比男人还要

Yehuda 博士还注意到了另一个男女之

Text 2

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory

would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the

authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review.

Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or

decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of

the results would have to subscribe to the journal.

No longer. The Internet–and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why

commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting

access to it- is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic

Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching

consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and

Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made

handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now,

been a key element of scientific endeavor.

The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in

part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core

scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The

International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are

more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than

1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.

This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals

are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main institutional

subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing

agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his

employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where

organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional

repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access,

where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making

it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form

of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.

26. In the first paragraph, the author discusses

753

[A] the background information of journal editing.

[B] the publication routine of laboratory reports.

[C] the relations of authors with journal publishers.

[D] the traditional process of journal publication.

27. Which of the following is true of the OECD report?

[A] It criticizes government-funded research.

[B] It introduces an effective means of publication.

[C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers.

[D] It benefits scientific research considerably.

28. According to the text, online publication is significant in that

[A] it provides an easier access to scientific results.

[B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers.

[C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge.

[D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research.

29. With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is required to

[A] cover the cost of its publication.

[B] subscribe to the journal publishing it.

[C] allow other online journals to use it freely.

[D] complete the peer-review before submission.

30. Which of the following best summarizes the main idea of the passage?

[A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers.

[B] A new mode of publication is emerging.

[C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication.

[D] Publication is rendered easier by online service.

Text 3

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National

Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however,

he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed

dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team

uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.

The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have

generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago,

today’s people- especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many

generations- apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get

any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty

much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright

State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from

the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.

Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients –

notably, protein – to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition

and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and

adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years,

a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease

to be published. Finally, there are openaccess

archives, where organizations such as

universities or international laboratories

support institutional repositories. Other

models exist that are hybrids of these three,

such as delayed open-access, where journals

allow only subscribers to read a paper for the

first six months, before making it freely

available to everyone who wishes to see it.

All this could change the traditional form of

the peer-review process, at least for the

publication of papers.

757

Control and Prevention, average height- 5′9 〞for men, 5′4 〞for women- hasn’t really

changed since 1960.

Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During

childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even

though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle

with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs.

“There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual

organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.

Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon,

senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent

of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for

basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to

predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by

and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”

[A] illustrate the change of height of NBA players.

[C] compare different generations of NBA players.

32. Which of the following plays a key role in body growth according to the text?

[B] Human height is conditioned by the upright posture.

[C] Americans are the tallest on average in the world.

[D] Larger babies tend to become taller in adulthood.

[B] the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged.

[C] genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen.

此之高的球员之一了。近几年那些身体状

的变化，这些运动的经理人们都非常乐意

重新裁制队服以适应球员们更高、更大的

身材。

但是，运动领域的这个趋势有可能掩

盖了一个没有被承认的现实：即从总体上

来说，美国人已经停止了长高。尽管现在

人们比起140 年前明显长高了2 英寸，但

是他们——尤其是那些出生在移民美国许

多代的家庭中的人们——很显然在20 世纪

够达到的程度”，Wright State 大学的人类

学家William Cameron Chumlea 说道。而对

于NBA 球员来说，他们身高增长的原因主

要在于现在从全球招募球员已经成为了一

种普遍的做法。

身高的增长一般在20 岁以后就停止

了，长高需要热量和营养物质——主要是

蛋白质——以供应身体组织的扩展。在20

In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington,

52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw- having

extracted them from the months of his slaves.

That’s far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember

from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles

slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by

DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had

fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have

scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral

compromises made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s

infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was

wrong and yet most did little to fight it.

More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of

their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also

understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped

to create.

For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was “like

having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George

Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have

signed the Constitution without protections for the “peculiar institution,” including a clause

that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.

And the statesmen’s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed

Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the

southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the

Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave

states.

Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children- though not Hemings herself or his

approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were

created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War,

fairly confident.”

In 1784, five years before he became

president of the United States, George

Washington, 52, was nearly toothless. So he

hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his

jaw- having extracted them from the months

of his slaves.

That’s far different image from the

cherry-tree-chopping George most people

remember from their history books. But

recently, many historians have begun to focus

on the roles slavery played in the lives of the

founding generation. They have been spurred

in part by DNA evidence made available in

1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas

Jefferson had fathered at least one child with

his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the

past 30 years have scholars examined history

1784 年，在当选美国总统的5 年前，52

岁的乔治·华盛顿几乎掉光了牙齿。因此他

雇了一个牙医为他移种了9 颗牙——这些

牙齿都来自于他的奴隶口中。

相比人们在历史书本中学到的那个坎

樱桃树的乔治，这是一个截然不同的形象。

但是近来很多历史学家都开始关注奴隶制

在美国开国的那一代人中所扮演的角色。

这在部分上是受1998 年那件著名的DNA

证据事件的影响，在那个事件中DNA 证据

几乎毫无疑问地证实了托马斯·杰弗逊和他

的奴隶Sally Hemings 至少生了一个孩子。

而学者们开始从下至上地研究历史还是近

30 年的事情。一些历史学家的著作揭示了

美国的早期领导人在最不稳固的建国初期

作出的道德妥协。更加重要的是，他们认

from the bottom up. Works of several

historians reveal the moral compromises

made by the nation’s early leaders and the

fragile nature of the country’s infancy. More

significantly, they argue that many of the

Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong

and yet most did little to fight it.

More than anything, the historians say,

the founders were hampered by the culture of

their time. While Washington and Jefferson

privately expressed distaste for slavery, they

also understood that it was part of the

political and economic bedrock of the country

they helped to create.

For one thing, the South could not afford

to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was

“like having a large bank account,” says

Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God:

George Washington, His Slaves, and the

Creation of America. The southern states

would not have signed the Constitution

without protections for the “peculiar

institution,” including a clause that counted a

slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of

congressional representation.

And the statesmen’s political lives

depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula

handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the

presidential election of 1800 by inflating the

votes of the southern states in the Electoral

College. Once in office, Jefferson extended

slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803;

the new land was carved into 13 states,

including three slave states.

Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children-

——但是他们很少用实际行动来进行反

抗。

历史学家们认为，最主要的原因就是

那些开国元勋们都受到了他们所处时代的

文化所限。当华盛顿和杰弗逊在私底下表

达他们对于奴隶制不满时，他们也知道奴

隶制是他们创建的这个国家的政治经济基

础的一部分。

一方面，南方的各个州无法承担废除

奴隶制带来的损失。拥有奴隶“就像拥有一

张数额巨大的银行存折”，《一个不完美的

上帝：乔治·华盛顿、他的奴隶和美国的建

立》一书作者Wiencek 说道。如果没有对

于这种“特殊制度”的保护，南方各州是不

会签署宪法的，这种保护包括了如下条款，

即在国会代表人数中一个奴隶可以算作五

分之三个公民。

政治家的政治生命也取决于奴隶制。

正是由于这个五分之三公式扩大了选举团

中南方州的选票，从而帮助杰弗逊在1800

年的总统选举中险胜。入主白宫以后，杰

弗逊在1803年通过购买路易斯安娜扩大了

奴隶制；这片新的土地后来被分为13 个州，

其中包括了三个蓄奴州。

但是，杰弗逊解放了Hemings 的孩子

——尽管他没有解放Hemings 自己和其他

的约150 名奴隶。华盛顿在目睹了黑人们

在革命战争中的勇敢之后，开始相信所有

人生来都是平等的，于是他不顾亲戚的反

对，坚持给予他的所有奴隶自由。而仅仅

在10 年前，解放奴隶的法案在弗吉尼亚才

得到了法律上的批准。
